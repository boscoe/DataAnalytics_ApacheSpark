Fox News drew 4.2 million viewers for Tuesday night’s coverage of the New Hampshire primary, the second-highest viewership for primary or caucus night coverage for any cable network dating to 2000. It was the highest rating for coverage of the New Hampshire primary for any cable network going back those 16 years.The biggest audience for primary or caucus coverage came last week when Fox News drew 4.5 million viewers for the contest in Iowa.CNN brought in 2.7 million viewers in prime time on Tuesday, a drop of about a million viewers from last week’s Iowa returns; part of that could be attributable to the fact that winners were declared earlier on Tuesday night than they were last week. MSNBC had 1.7 million viewers on Tuesday. This was MSNBC’s most-viewed New Hampshire primary night ever, and CNN’s second-best, behind 2008.Fox News also had the most viewers in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic with 992,000, which beat CNN’s 951,000 and MSNBC’s 494,000.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
