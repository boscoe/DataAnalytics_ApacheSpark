The Justice Department sued to block the pending merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes on Wednesday, the latest instance of the Obama administration taking a tougher stance on big-ticket deals.In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Delaware, the Justice Department argued that combining the two oil field services companies would cut competition in the industry to unacceptable levels.“The proposed deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers,” Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in a statement. “Our action makes clear that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our antitrust laws. In the days ahead, we will continue to stand up for fair deals and free markets, and for the American people we are privileged to serve.”In a statement announcing the lawsuit, the Justice Department said that Halliburton had proposed selling some assets to win approval, but not enough to satisfy the government’s concerns.AdvertisementShares of Halliburton rose nearly 5 percent in morning trading on Wednesday, while shares of Baker Hughes rose 4.4 percent.AdvertisementWednesday’s lawsuit came after the cancellation of Pfizer’s planned $152 billion merger with Allergan, after the Obama administration introduced new tax rules this week that analysts and legal experts concluded was aimed in part at making that deal unattractive to the companies involved.The administration has taken aim at a number of potential mergers during its tenure, including AT&T’s effort to buy T-Mobile USA, which was later dropped, and American Airlines’ successful merger with US Airways.Several other big mergers, including a huge wave of consolidation in the health insurance sector, are still pending.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
