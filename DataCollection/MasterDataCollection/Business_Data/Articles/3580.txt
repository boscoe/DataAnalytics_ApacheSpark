LOS ANGELES — In the British equivalent of fines levied by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a Disney subsidiary was charged on Thursday with four safety breaches on the Pinewood Studios set of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”The workplace agency, the Health and Safety Executive, issued the criminal charges against Foodles Productions — a name chosen in an effort to hide the filming of “Star Wars” from overzealous fans — over an accident in June 2014 when Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Han Solo, was struck by a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon spaceship. Mr. Ford’s leg was broken, and production was interrupted for two weeks.“By law, employers must take reasonable steps to protect workers — this is as true on a film set as a factory floor,” the Health and Safety Executive said in a statement. A court hearing was scheduled for May 12 at High Wycombe Magistrates’ Court.A Foodles spokesman said in a statement: “Cast and crew safety is always a top priority. We provided full cooperation during H.S.E.’s investigation into the on-set accident that occurred in June 2014 and are disappointed in H.S.E.’s decision.”A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; ‘Star Wars’ Company Fined After an On-Set Injury.
