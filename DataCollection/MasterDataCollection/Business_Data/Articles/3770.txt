At a congressional hearing last week, financial industry representatives pushed for legislation that would chip away at consumer protection rules governing the three major credit reporting bureaus. Loosening those regulations “would provide economic stability” by capping the industry’s exposure to class-action claims, a trade group official testified.Hours later, one of the three bureaus, Equifax, disclosed a major data breach, which has potentially compromised the sensitive personal data of more than 143 million Americans.Capitol Hill is now demanding answers about the cyberattack. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and at least six state attorneys general have opened investigations.While authorities and consumers are calling for action, the push is unlikely to translate into new rules or legal curbs.AdvertisementThe credit bureaus have for decades successfully fended off calls in Congress for more oversight, despite warnings about potential problems that go back to Senator William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the 1960s. Now, the industry is likely to find support in the agenda of President Trump, who has pledged to strip away “burdensome” business regulations.AdvertisementRegulators aren’t likely to fill the void. The F.T.C., which oversees data protection, can’t dole out big financial punishments. While the consumer bureau has shown a willingness to take on the industry, the agency is mainly focused on the accuracy of the data and the products that are sold to consumers.“I have no reason to believe that this Congress has the capacity or will to actually legislate on those issues,” said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. “The most we could see passing is targeted legislation aimed at enhancing consumer protections following identity theft.”For years, consumer advocates have pressed for stricter oversight of the credit bureaus and stronger privacy rules covering all companies. One often-pursued goal is a federal privacy law mandating notifications to those whose personal information has been compromised, as well as meaningful financial penalties for lax data protection.While forty-eight states have passed  security breach notification laws, calls for a nationwide standard have repeatedly fizzled. And Equifax has been a powerful force in the legislative and regulatory arena.Equifax spent $1.1 million on lobbying last year, up from $300,000 in 2006, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. The credit bureau recently lobbied on a range of cybersecurity issues, including “data security and breach notification,” “data breach response and identity protection” and “cybersecurity threat information sharing.”Equifax lobbied on two bills under scrutiny at last week’s House hearing, including one called the F.C.R.A. Liability Harmonization Act. The six proposals discussed at the hearing, all introduced by Republicans, would amend, and often scale back, a variety of consumer protection laws. The various proposals would ease certain mortgage lending rules, narrow the scope of debt collection restrictions and limit corporate liability by capping financial penalties for violations of the F.C.R.A., the Fair Credit Reporting Act.Meredith Griffanti, a spokeswoman for Equifax, said the company “works to ensure that new legislation captures the benefits of credit reporting to the U.S. economy, as well as the effects of certain regulation on the financial system.”Advertisement“We believe in fair industry regulation,” she added, “and advocating for policies that protect consumers’ rights, as well as the integrity of the consumer data industry.”Congress has sounded warnings for decades.In the 1960s, a series of congressional hearings pulled the secretive industry into a public spotlight. Aggrieved customers, academic experts, and industry insiders spoke out about how the vendors — including Equifax, then known as the Retail Credit Company — amassed files filled with intimate personal information on millions of people.
            Hackers broke into Equifax, accessing data for 143 million Americans. Here’s what happened, how it’s being handled and what you can do to protect your information:        The bureaus hired thousands of investigators to ferret out details on subjects’ financial habits and their “moral character,” according to the hearings. Drinking, philandering or simply having a dispute with a gossipy neighbor could lead to black marks.Those credit files, which helped determine who could get a business loan, rent an apartment or even land a job, were available for purchase by any creditor. But they were kept hidden from the subjects themselves.Senator Proxmire was a vocal critic of the power and the secrecy of credit bureaus. Without strict oversight, he thought the industry might be tempted to cut corners on data protection.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Passed with broad support, it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970.The act “provides significant remedy and relief,” said Leonard Bennett, a consumer attorney in Newport News, Va.The act gave consumers the right — for the first time — to view their own credit reports. It also forced the credit bureaus to create a dispute process to allow people to challenge inaccuracies.AdvertisementBut it placed enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, which has limited supervisory powers and little ability to levy significant penalties. When the agency finds wrongdoing, it takes companies to court to force corrections, but it can generally only impose fines for repeated violations.The F.T.C.’s approach is “remedial,” and focused on noneconomic punishment, said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote a book about the F.T.C.’s enforcement of privacy laws.With little federal oversight, the credit bureaus rapidly expanded beyond their core business of building consumer credit dossiers for lenders and other companies. In 2000, Equifax started selling online credit scores and credit monitoring products directly to American consumers. That line of business is a small, but lucrative, part of Equifax’s empire.The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in 2011, has begun to rein in the industry, to some degree.In a series of investigations, the C.F.P.B. found that the credit bureaus lacked sufficient quality controls to make sure consumers’ data was accurate, and forced the bureaus to make changes. The agency also pressed the companies to improve their processes for fixing errors.“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has moved the needle and has gotten them to think about compliance, at least on accuracy issues,” said Chi Chi Wu, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.One new consumer protection initiative may have been inadvertently saved by the backlash over Equifax’s response to its data breach.The consumer bureau recently finalized a rule prohibiting companies from forcing customers into arbitration over disputes, a method that companies have used to block class-action lawsuits. Equifax initially included a mandatory arbitration clause in the fine print of the free credit monitoring product offered in the wake of the attack — language that could have prevented victims from banding together in court.Customers immediately cried foul. Equifax quickly backed down and removed the clause.A bill to repeal the consumer bureau’s arbitration rule passed the House in July, but has not yet been voted on in the Senate. Now, it is considered highly unlikely to advance.A version of this article appears in print on September 15, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Equifax Breach Spurs Inquiry, but New Rules Unlikely After Years of Laxity.
