Former judges like Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul appeared on stage, while dozens of former contestants like Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson and (a very pregnant) Kelly Clarkson performed. Trent Harmon was announced as the final “American Idol” winner, beating out La’Porsha Renae.The show was once a ratings juggernaut for Fox. At its height 10 years ago, it routinely drew 30 million viewers an episode, the sort of numbers that these days are reserved for National Football League playoff games.But in the years since, viewership declined on a nearly annual basis, and “American Idol” was usurped by NBC’s “The Voice” as television’s preferred singing competition show. Fox announced in May that this would be its final season.In addition to strong ratings, “American Idol” also ate up lots of hours on Fox’s lineup over the last decade. Next season, Fox will have the added challenge of finding a new slate of shows that can reliably fill that space.For the season, Fox is now in last place among the four networks in total viewers, and in third place, ahead of ABC, in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen.Advertisement
