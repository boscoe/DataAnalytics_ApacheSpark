Another telecommunications deal in Europe has fallen apart.On Friday, Orange, the former French telecom monopoly, and Bouygues Telecom, a local rival, called off takeover talks after failing to agree on a proposed deal worth 10 billion euros, or $11.4 billion.The move is the latest in a growing list of mergers in the European telecommunications industry that have faltered after the region’s antitrust authorities raised questions about whether further industry consolidation would be in the best interest of customers.Such concerns have already upended a number of proposed deals, including a prospective merger last year between two of Denmark’s largest telecom operators. Potential combinations, including a much-rumored deal between Vodafone, the telecom based in London, and Liberty Global, the cable company controlled by John C. Malone, have also failed to emerge.Antitrust concerns were raised at the time of Orange’s proposed takeover of Bouygues Telecom in January, but both sides said on Friday that the failure to reach terms on the deal, and not potential competition issues, had scuttled the takeover.AdvertisementIn particular, Bouygues, a French conglomerate that owns Bouygues Telecom, said in a statement that it had failed to reach agreement on its stake in the new entity and on the valuation of the company’s telecom unit.AdvertisementThe company said it also had concerns about whether the deal would be approved by the country’s authorities.Analysts expected Orange to sell off part of the enlarged entity to national rivals to win regulatory approval. It also remained unclear how much of a stake the French government, which owns a minority stake in Orange, would have retained if the takeover had been approved.“In a market where the possibility of consolidation is now ruled out for the long term, Bouygues Telecom will continue its stand-alone strategy,” the company said in its statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
