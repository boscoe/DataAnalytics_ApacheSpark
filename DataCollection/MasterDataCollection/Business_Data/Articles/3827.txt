What a difference a year makes. The billionaire investor William A. Ackman had a knockout 2014, prompting some to compare him to Warren E. Buffett. In 2015, Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund has slumped to the bottom of the industry’s worst-performing list.Pershing Square Holdings finished the year with a 20.5 percent loss — the worst in its 11-year history — as some of its biggest public stock holdings were beaten down. Pershing Square became a top shareholder in the embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals, but by the end of the year, the company’s shares had fallen 61 percent from a peak they reached over the summer. (Valeant shares bounced back significantly from the lows it hit in November.)In November, Mr. Ackman sharply increased his position in Valeant to 9.9 percent from 5.7 percent as the shares dropped to a record low. Last week, he sold some of those shares. His stake in Valeant is now 8.5 percent of the company shares, according a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm sold its shares “in order to generate a tax loss for their investors,” the filing said.Pershing Square Holdings, which has $5.2 billion in assets under management, is one of several funds that Mr. Ackman manages. The performance figure was reported in an update to investors. All together, Mr. Ackman manages $14.9 billion for investors, including individuals and institutions like pension funds.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
