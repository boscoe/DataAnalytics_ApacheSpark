In a vitriolic campaign season, one of the few things that the candidates could agree on was their desire to see more spending on the highways, rail lines, ports and dams that make up our national infrastructure. Relatively early in the campaign season, Donald J. Trump met Hillary Clinton’s announcement of a huge infrastructure package, worth $275 billion, by announcing one that would be more than twice as big.On election night, it was this promise, more than any other issue, that he returned to. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” he said in his acceptance speech on Tuesday night.Infrastructure is an appealing cause because it provides a straightforward way for the government to inject money into the economy and build the foundation for longer term economic growth. But some economists say returns from infrastructure spending are likely to be much less pronounced than they were in the past, in part because the highest yielding infrastructure is already in place. Looking at infrastructure data from different sources provides conflicting pictures of what needs to be done, but it is a topic worth examining from as many perspectives as possible.

Every few years the American Society of Civil Engineers puts out a widely distributed report card for our national infrastructure. In 2013 the overall grade was a D+. There are reasons to take the grim picture presented by the report card with a grain of salt: The group has an interest in making the country’s infrastructure situation look as bad as possible, so that more civil engineers are hired to fix it. But the report card provides one of the most comprehensive snapshots of where we are, and are not, spending money, and where the needs are likely to be the greatest in the coming years.Infrastructure needs through 2020 versusamounts funded by 2013In billions of2010 dollarsAMOUNTFUNDEDAMOUNTNEEDEDSurfacetransportation$877$1,723629736Electricity120391SchoolsPublic parks& recreation13423895134AirportsWater/wastewaterinfrastructure4212689100Rail880LeveesHazardous &solid waste1056Inland waterways& marine ports1430621DamsInfrastructure needs through 2020 versus amounts funded by 2013In billions of 2010 dollarsInland waterways& marine portsDams$30Levees$21$80$14Electricity$6$736AMOUNT NEEDED$8Public parks & recreationWater/wastewaterinfrastructure$238$126$629AMOUNT FUNDED$42$134Surface transportation$1,723Schools$391$120Airports$134RailHazardous &solid waste$100$877$56$95$89$10Infrastructure needs through 2020 versus amounts funded by 2013In billions of 2010 dollarsInland waterways& marine portsLevees$30Electricity$80$14$736AMOUNT NEEDEDDams$8$21$6Water/wastewaterinfrastructure$126$629AMOUNT FUNDED$42Surface transportation$1,723Hazardous &solid waste$56$877$10AirportsSchools$391$134Public parks & recreation$238$95Rail$100$120$89$134To get a sense of how the quality of America’s infrastructure has changed over time — and how it compares with infrastructure in other countries — one of the best tools available is the World Economic Forum’s survey of global executives. It is worth remembering that these figures come from a survey of the most powerful members of society, not the poor, who might experience the shortcomings of our infrastructure more intimately. But the figures suggest that America’s infrastructure still stands up quite well to international comparison and is not in precipitous decline.Global executives opinions of infrastructure in their countriesOVERALLINFRASTRUCTUREAIRTRANSPORTELECTRICITYSUPPLYPORTSROADSRAILROADS7.0BESTGermany6.56.0U.S.5.55.0Britain4.5China4.03.5AVERAGE’07’15’07’15’07’15’07’15’07’15’07’15Global executives opinions of infrastructurein their countriesAIRTRANSPORTPORTSROADS7.0BESTGermany6.56.0U.S.5.55.0Britain4.5China4.03.5AVG.’07’15’07’15’07’15OVERALLINFRASTRUCTUREELECTRICITYSUPPLYRAILROADS7.0BEST6.56.05.55.04.54.03.5AVG.’07’15’07’15’07’15Economists have provided vastly different estimates on how much infrastructure spending can be relied on to generate long-term economic growth. All sides, though, agree that the outcome depends in large part on the particular timing and location of the spending. In an earlier era, for instance, new roads vastly expanded the opportunities available to American businesses. Nowadays, spending on highways appears to come with significantly lower returns.35%Annual rateof return frominvestment inhighways 1950s35%1960s16%1970s10%1980sAnnual rate of return from investment in highways 1980s1970s1960s1950s10%16%35%35%For politicians, it is generally more attractive to spend money on new projects, with their ribbon cuttings and news coverage, than on the boring maintenance of existing roads and public works. Infrastructure experts complain that this has led to a persistent underinvestment in maintenance. New data, though, suggests that politicians and bureaucrats have become aware of the problem and are focusing more on important but unrewarding maintenance work.Average annual state spending on road exansion and repair(In billions)2009-20112012-2014EXPANSIONREPAIREXPANSIONREPAIR$22.1$16.5$18.0$23.4Average annual state spending onroad exansion and repair(In billions)2009-2011EXPANSIONREPAIR$22.1$16.52012-2014EXPANSIONREPAIR$18.0$23.4The federal gas tax was set at 18.4 cents a gallon in 1993, and it has not been changed since. The fixed rate of the tax, along with the increasing fuel efficiency of American cars, has meant that gas tax revenues have not kept up with inflation and the costs of maintaining our roads. The federal government has had to chip in money from its general fund to make up for the shortfalls, but Congress has been reluctant to continue doing this. States and local municipalities are increasingly looking to tolls and user fees to pay for new roads and repairs.Revenue derived from fuel taxesSource of resources used for highways, 2012(In billions of 2013 dollars)FEDERALSTATE$6012Bonds11Tolls50STATE4066%Fuel tax31%FEDERAL302013Vehicle tax21107Other19014General fund6’00’05’10’13Revenue derived from fuel taxes(In billions of 2013 dollars)$6050STATE40FEDERAL3020100’00’05’10’13Source of resources used for highways, 2012FEDERALSTATE12Bonds11Tolls66%Fuel tax31%13Vehicle tax217Other1914General fund6Advertisement
