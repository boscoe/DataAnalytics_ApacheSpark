Lew, himself a former Citigroup executive.The A.F.L.-C.I.O. says the payments undermine the independence of government officials who regulate Wall Street. It is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow its proposal onto the proxies of the banks for consideration at their annual shareholder meetings this spring.Bank of America, JPMorgan, Lazard and Morgan Stanley have asked the S.E.C. for permission to keep the proposal off their proxies, according to Heather Slavkin Corzo, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s director of investment. She says her office hasn’t yet heard from Goldman or Citigroup.In letters to the regulator, the banks argue that the proposal is too vague and could have unintended consequences.The banks were not able to keep a similar measure excluded from their proxies last year. That proposal, also by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called on the banks to disclose which executives are eligible for such perks and to estimate the value of their payouts.Goldman recommended shareholders vote against last year’s proposal, saying it disagreed with the premise, which penalizes senior employees for choosing government service.The proposals did not pass any of the banks’ shareholder votes (none received more than 26 percent support), but there was enough momentum to encourage another attempt this year, Ms. Slavkin Corzo said.Advertisement
