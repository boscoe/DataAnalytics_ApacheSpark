Polls show the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump appears to have tightened after last week’s news that the F.B.I. had discovered new emails that might be relevant to the completed investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server.AdvertisementThe narrowing in the race has introduced a new element of uncertainty into financial markets, something that analysts say is likely to keep trading in check.AdvertisementThere were several signs of nervousness in the market. Gold prices rose and the Mexican peso, which has become an indicator of Mr. Trump’s chances to win, has been falling steadily against the United States dollar since Friday. The peso lost nearly 2 percent against the dollar, a significant move in currency trading.“While Hillary Clinton is still expected to win the final vote, email concerns notwithstanding, next week’s outcome could well be too close for comfort,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.

Notably, the VIX index, a measure of volatility, jumped 14 percent on Tuesday to its highest level since June.“The tightening in the polls has gotten the market into a bit of a risk-reduction mode,” said Thomas L. di Galoma, managing director of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings. “A week ago it was a Clinton blowout. Now, all of a sudden, it’s turning into a bit of a race.”Outside the election, investors will be watching the Federal Reserve, which wraps up a two-day meeting on Wednesday.
