Stock market indicators avoided big losses on Wednesday, finishing the day mixed.Earlier, stocks appeared to be headed for a second day of notable losses, but they recovered some of that lost ground in late trading.Weak earnings for major companies hurt real estate investment trusts and health care companies. Tech stocks slid as investors were unimpressed with Apple’s latest results. Banks continued to report strong earnings, and Boeing helped lift industrial companies.Stocks have not made many big moves in the last two weeks. “Trading volume has really dropped off,” said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said investors were being cautious as they waited for the outcome of November’s election.

The Dow Jones industrial average added 30.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,199.33. In early trading, it fell more than 100 points. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shaved off 3.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,139.43. The Nasdaq composite shed 33.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,250.27.AdvertisementWhile individual companies might rise or fall based on their earnings, Mr. Wren said investors did not care that much if overall corporate profits rose or fell this quarter. Earnings have been falling for more than a year, but the drops are getting smaller.Advertisement“All the market wants in terms of earnings is a continuation of a pattern this year of quarter-to-quarter improvement,” he said.But investors did bid down Apple after the company reported another drop in iPhone sales. Apple gets about two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone. Apple sank $2.66, or 2.2 percent, to $115.59. The company said it expected sales to start growing again in the holiday season after a recent slump.

The losses for Apple, by far the biggest company in the S.&P. 500, sent tech stocks lower. That canceled out big jumps in Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, which each surged more than 10 percent after strong results.Financial firms continued to report strong third-quarter results. The regional bank Huntington Bancshares gained 51 cents, or 5 percent, to $10.70 and the insurer Chubb rose $4.55, or 3.7 percent, to $127.Shares of the drug company Mylan fell after Kaleo Pharmaceuticals said it would resume selling its emergency allergy shot Auvi-Q next year. That would mean more competition for Mylan’s EpiPen. Auvi-Q was taken off the market last year because of the potential for inaccurate dosing.Mylan lost 60 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $38.08.A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Apple iPhone Sales Are a Drag on Tech as Markets React to Earnings Reports.
