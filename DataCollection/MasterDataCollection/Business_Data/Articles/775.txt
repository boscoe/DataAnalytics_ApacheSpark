The decision was expected as Russia had repeatedly said it would regard nonpayment as a default and file a lawsuit. The Eurobond was issued by the government of the former President Viktor Yanukovych in late 2013 and bought by Russia in its entirety. Ukraine’s prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, had said that Ukraine would not repay the Eurobond and that it was ready to fight the issue in court. A grace period for repayment expired on Thursday. The bond was issued just two months before Mr. Yanukovych fled in the face of bloody street protests set off by his seeking to halt Ukraine’s swing toward European integration in favor of closer economic ties with Russia. Ukraine, which separately reached an agreement with private creditors to restructure its sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed debt, insisted that the Eurobond was commercial debt and that it could not offer Russia a better deal than other creditors. Russia says the debt is official, country-to-country lending and outside the scope of Kiev’s agreement with private creditors. Advertisement
