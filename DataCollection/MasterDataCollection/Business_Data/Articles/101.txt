Divorce can be messy, even when both sides start out wanting an amicable settlement. Brexit may well work the same way now that Prime Minister Theresa May has started the process for Britain’s exit from the European Union.For now, investors are more hopeful than they were six months ago that Britain can quit the bloc without ravaging its economy, a Reuters Breakingviews index based on asset prices shows.The index incorporates currency, bond, stock and credit-default swap prices. It falls when investors think a growth-damaging “hard Brexit” is more likely, and rises when they expect a more benign outcome.When the former occurs, the pound typically weakens and the domestically focused FTSE 250 index of midcap companies is apt to underperform the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies, which tend to be more global.AdvertisementInvestors also tend to push up the cost of insuring against a British debt default relative to Germany, and compress the gap between the yields of two- and 10-year British government notes.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The index has since clawed back some ground, though, not least because growth has proved far more resilient than most investors and policy makers expected.AdvertisementYet the chances are that the gauge will fall in the months ahead.Mrs. May wants to clamp down on immigration from other countries in the European Union, but has so far been able to avoid tricky questions about what sort of trade restrictions others will want to impose. The economic price that Britain may pay will become increasingly clear now that negotiations can start.And even before any trade barriers are erected, growth could slow. Rising inflation is eroding the spending power of households. And jobs and business investment may be more vulnerable if talks start to look rancorous.Indeed, investors may be underestimating how closely political divorces can match real ones for bitterness and damage.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
