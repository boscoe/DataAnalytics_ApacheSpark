Microsoft has been working on Hololens, and Apple is reportedly at work on its own efforts.But Magic Leap has drawn attention for the prominent investors it has attracted — Google, Fidelity Investments and Warner Brothers, among others — despite being almost completely closed off from showing the public any of its products. Only occasionally do the founders pop up to give interviews.“Here at Magic Leap, we are creating a new world where digital and physical realities seamlessly blend together to enable amazing new experiences,” Rony Abovitz, founder and chief executive of Magic Leap, said in a statement. “This investment will accelerate bringing our new Mixed Reality Lightfield experience to everyone.”This most recent round was led by Alibaba, the large Chinese e-commerce company, with participation from new investors including J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates. Magic Leap has raised more than $1 billion in funding to date.Advertisement
