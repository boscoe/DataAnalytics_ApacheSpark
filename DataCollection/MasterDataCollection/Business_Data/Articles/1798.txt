HarperCollins, a subsidiary of News Corporation, announced the deal on Thursday night.Ms. Kelly’s book will be edited by Matt Harper, the HarperCollins executive editor, and released in the fall. Financial terms were not disclosed, but it was rumored to be a multimillion-dollar deal.“Megyn Kelly is among the most interesting and influential people in America today and we are thrilled to be publishing her first book,” said Lisa Sharkey, HarperCollins’s senior vice president for creative development, in a statement. “This book is coming out at the perfect time and is bound to be one of the most read and talked about books of the fall.”Ms. Kelly, who hosts “The Kelly File” on Fox News, was a moderator at the first Republican presidential debate last summer, in which she questioned Mr. Trump about his disparaging remarks about women. Mr. Trump accused her of unfairly attacking him, and he has ranted against her in interviews and on social media.Last week, Mr. Trump refused to participate in a Republican debate on Fox News after the network rejected his demand that it remove Ms. Kelly as a moderator. The debate went on without Mr. Trump — a glaring absence Ms. Kelly characterized as “the elephant not in the room.”Advertisement
