LONDON — Tata Steel of India agreed on Monday to sell part of its British business to the investment firm Greybull Capital, preventing thousands of job losses and freeing it up to focus on the sale of its other big plant in Britain.The British government has been under pressure to ensure that the Tata plants are sold rather than shut down after the steel maker, one of the world’s biggest, said on March 30 that it would sell its unprofitable British business, possibly putting 15,000 jobs at risk.Greybull said it would buy Tata’s Long Products Europe division in Scunthorpe, in Northern England, which employs 4,400 people. Separately, the process to try to find a buyer for Tata’s other major British plant, at Port Talbot in Wales, began on Monday.Greybull said it was arranging a 400 million pound, or $565 million, investment and financing package for the Scunthorpe business, as part of a deal that included an agreement with suppliers and trade unions.AdvertisementIf the deal is completed, the unit will be renamed British Steel, a company name that has not been used in almost two decades. The agreement is expected to be completed in eight weeks and is subject to certain conditions, including a vote by trade union members.AdvertisementPrime Minister David Cameron, already grappling with divisions over whether Britain should remain in the European Union, disagreement over the national budget and questions about his inheritance and  taxes, had been scrambling to find buyers for Tata assets and to save jobs.Tata, one of the largest steel producers in Europe, put its British operations up for sale last month, citing a global oversupply of steel and cheaper imports from China, high costs and weak domestic demand.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That also included two mills, an engineering workshop and a design consultancy, as well as a mill in Hayange, France.Finding buyers for the Port Talbot assets, which employ 4,000 people, could take time given the complexities involved in reaching a deal, including negotiations over a wide range of items, like pension liabilities and energy subsidies.Greybull said that it had been wholly focused on the Scunthorpe deal, but it did not rule out future interest in the Port Talbot plant.“Whether it’s Tata or any other assets, we’ll review it as and when is appropriate,” said Marc Meyohas, a partner at the investment firm.Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of the commodities trader Liberty House Group, is also a possible bidder for the Port Talbot plant. He told Reuters on Friday that he was serious about making an offer for the Welsh assets, and that he had the backing of a group with $7 billion in revenue.Tata, under its former chairman, Ratan N. Tata, bought the British steel operations in 2007. It had outbid CSN of Brazil for the British-Dutch steel maker Corus for $12 billion, seeking to gain access to European markets.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
