AdvertisementSupported byBy Emily SteelVerizon Communications is trying to get a little more awesome.On Wednesday, the company announced that it had struck a deal to acquire a 24.5 percent stake in AwesomenessTV, the digital entertainment network for teenagers and young adults.The companies also are planning to create a new subscription-based, short-form mobile video service. It is aimed at 18- to 34-year-olds and will be part of the Go90 streaming offering from Verizon.“We are capitalizing on the emergence of these strong media brands that can reach millennials and Generation Z,” said Brian Angiolet, Verizon’s senior vice president for consumer product and marketing. “It’s like we’re in the early days of cable, and we want to participate more fully in the economics of that trend.”Verizon’s deal values AwesomenessTV at about $650 million, significantly more than the $33 million that the Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation paid it in 2013.In 2014, DreamWorks sold a 25 percent stake in AwesomenessTV to Hearst for $81.25 million, at a value of about $325 million. DreamWorks and Hearst will continue to hold their stakes in the company.The deal is Verizon’s latest effort to reach elusive millennial viewers. The company introduced Go90, which is free to viewers and supported by ads, in the fall with a mix of live events, prime-time TV programming and original web series.Last month, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture with Hearst to develop programming for young adults to watch on their phones.At the same time, Verizon’s rival AT&T has been pushing into digital media.Two years ago, the company formed a joint venture with The Chernin Group called Otter Media, committing more than $500 million to the enterprise. The company has acquired and invested stakes in a number of digital entertainment and streaming networks, including Fullscreen, Ellation and Gunpowder & Sky. Just last week, the group announced that it was turning Fullscreen into a subscription-based streaming service.AwesomenessTV programming is already available on Go90, and Mr. Angiolet said that its content had exceeded Verizon’s expectations in attracting audiences and generating return viewers. Part of the strategy for Go90 was to expand upon an ad-supported offering, and Verizon’s deal with AwesomenessTV jump-starts that initiative with the new subscription service, he said.The content will be available exclusively on Verizon platforms in the United States, and AwesomenessTV has the rights to sell the content outside the country.“The creation of this new branded service represents a transformational step, not just for AwesomenessTV, but also for the entire mobile video landscape,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, said in a statement.AwesomenessTV plans to create new series for the offering that will feature “highly serialized drama and comedies,” said Brian Robbins, chief executive of AwesomenessTV. Episodes will last eight to 10 minutes, and there will be 10 to 12 episodes a season, he added.Executives said that they were not yet ready to announce specific projects and that they were completing payment models and price points. They compared the new service — which has yet to be named — to an HBO or Netflix service, created specifically for the mobile generation.“We believe the next evolution of short-form content is just superhigh-quality scripted content,” Mr. Robbins said.Advertisement
