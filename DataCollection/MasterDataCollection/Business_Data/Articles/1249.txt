General Motors said on Friday that plaintiffs’ lawyers suing over a faulty ignition switch linked to nearly 400 injuries and deaths have chosen to dismiss what was scheduled to be the fourth in a series of six test trials over the defect covering about 235 injury and wrongful-death cases that are pending in state and federal courts. The decision came a day after G.M. settled what was to be the third lawsuit to go to trial, and followed a win for the automaker a week ago in the first of the so-called bellwether trials to reach a verdict. G.M. has admitted some employees knew about the problems for years, and has paid about $2 billion in settlements and penalties over the defect. The fourth case set for trial was brought by Robert Reid, an Alabama resident suing over injuries he sustained in a 2013 accident. But in a filing in federal court in Manhattan on Friday, G.M. and his lawyers said the case would be dismissed. A G.M. spokesman said there was no settlement as part of the dismissal. A lawyer for Mr. Reid did not respond to requests for comment.A version of this article appears in print on April 9, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fourth Bellwether Trial on G.M.
