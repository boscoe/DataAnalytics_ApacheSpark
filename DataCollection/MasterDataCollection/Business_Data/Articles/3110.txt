When the inaugural race of the 2017 Formula One season starts in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday, it will mark the first time in 43 years that Bernie Ecclestone will not be running the racing series.He was swept aside in late January when the Liberty Media Corporation, the Colorado-based company whose chairman is John C. Malone, completed its purchase of a 35.5 percent stake of Formula One.So while Ecclestone, 86, was an outsize personality who often dominated the headlines, occasionally overshadowing what was happening on the track, this season’s questions are all about the changes to the cars, whether the Mercedes team really can win the drivers’ and constructors’ championships for a fourth year in a row, and what the new owners have in store for Formula One.Formula One Management is now run by Chase Carey, the former executive vice chairman of 21st Century Fox, who said when he was appointed chief executive that the business, and the sport, has not reached full potential. He said the races need to be more of a spectacle, becoming “21 Super Bowls,” with “weeklong extravaganzas with entertainment and music that capture a whole city.”AdvertisementTo help him, Carey appointed the Formula One veteran Ross Brawn as managing director of motorsports and Sean Bratches, a former executive vice president for sales and marketing at ESPN, as managing director of commercial operations.AdvertisementFor Brawn, it is a return to Formula One after an absence of just over three years. He had previously played a key role in winning 20 world titles with the Benetton, Brawn GP, Ferrari and Williams teams.“One of the things they need credit for so far is putting Ross in place because there is nobody out there who is a better choice than him,” said Guenther Steiner, the Haas team principal. “That was a really good decision, and hopefully, they will make a lot more like this.”It is unclear what changes the new owners will make, but over the last few weeks, Carey, Brawn and Bratches have been canvassing opinions, taking stock before making changes. Bratches described it as “a listening tour.”And the leading players in Formula One have a range of opinions on what needs to be done to improve the sport. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said “there are some relatively low-hanging fruit,” like digital and social media strategies, from which Ecclestone admitted he had difficulty making money. He once called social media “nonsense.”Paul Hembery, the Pirelli motorsport director, said he believed “we have got to get the driver back to being the star of the show” because “at the moment there are too many other elements that dominate.”Steiner, of the Haas team, said Formula One needed “more people to watch us, more exposure, that there are more eyeballs on a screen.”Bob Fernley, the Force India deputy team principal, said he has long wanted a “more equitable income stream.”AdvertisementAt present, the 10 teams (Manor dropped out after last season) each receive an equal base payment for competing in the championship, and an additional payment based on how they place in the final standings, with the team winning the title receiving 19 percent of the prize pot and the team in 10th getting 4 percent. Mercedes received $63.5 million for winning the constructors’ championship in 2015, the latest year for which figures are available. But there are other payouts as well that have nothing to do with how a team performs in a season.In an interview, Bratches acknowledged the need for a more diverse income stream and also said that many changes are coming.“Our view is we want to get away from a deal-oriented, transactional structure and create a strategic plan we execute rigorously, with the sport in mind and with the fans at the center of everything we do,” he said.Bratches said the one fundamental that came across from the discussions with principals is that the fans, whether in the grandstands or watching elsewhere, will come first.“From our vantage point, we are the custodians of a truly great global sports brand, and we’re inspired by its potential and awed by the responsibility, which we take very seriously,” he said. “So everything we do, and all the decisions we make will be about putting the fan first, about being fan-centric, and build out from that.”Bratches said he also wants to create deeper relationships with commercial partners.“There are a number of opportunities to support our promoters and amplify that experience for fans that will relate to a better sport for everyone involved,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If you’re sitting at home watching an event, you want to be thinking: ‘Wow! I’d really like to be there and a part of that.’”Ecclestone still remains a part of Formula One in the honorary role of chairman emeritus, available “as a source of advice for the board of F1,” Liberty said in a statement when the deal closed in January.AdvertisementAfter initially acquiring the Brabham team in 1972, Ecclestone recognized the commercial opportunities available in Formula One, initially with the circuit owners and then the television companies, transforming it into a business worth an estimated $8 billion today.When Liberty confirmed its takeover of Formula One last September, it said Ecclestone would remain as chief executive, with Carey becoming chairman.Four months later, after Liberty officially bought Formula One, Ecclestone was out as chief executive.Ecclestone, who often joked that the only way he would leave Formula One was in a wooden box, said in an interview that the change has left him with a considerable void.“It’s obviously different,” he said. “As you know, I was very hands-on, 24-7. Now it’s getting used to not being under so much pressure.“I’ve more free time, sure. More or less if I want to disappear for a day I can do that. I don’t do it anyway, but at least I can if I want to.”He said he goes to the office in London, early in the morning. “I’m there until the evening,” remaining on call, “waiting to see if they need any help,” although he said he does not hear much from the new owners.He said that since the takeover he had never met Bratches and had “seen very little” of Carey, as Liberty appears intent on making its own mark on Formula One and leaving the Ecclestone era behind.Ecclestone said he still plans to attend a few races, saying that “most of the people I’ve dealt with are good close friends.”AdvertisementAsked whether he was going to miss participating, he said, “Anybody that has been doing a job for 40 years would miss it.”A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2017, in The International New York Times.
