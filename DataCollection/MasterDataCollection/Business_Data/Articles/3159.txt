LONDON — Britain’s largest banks would have to hold an additional buffer of capital under newly proposed rules meant to protect their retail banking businesses in a financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Friday.The new buffer is among a series of rules being proposed by the central bank as it requires British lenders to quarantine their retail banking operations from investment banking and other riskier businesses by 2019 — a practice known as ring-fencing.Under the latest proposal, banks and building societies with more than 175 billion pounds, or about $250 billion, in total assets would have to maintain a so-called systemic risk buffer beginning in 2019, the central bank said.The new buffer, which had been anticipated, would be equivalent to as much as 3 percent of a lender’s assets as measured by risk, the Bank of England said.AdvertisementThe central bank expects to conclude a public consultation period on the proposed buffer in April and finish its capital framework requirements for ring-fenced banks by the end of May. The ring-fencing rules would go into effect in 2019.Advertisement“These new rules will mean that large U.K. banks and building societies are more resilient to adverse shocks, enabling them to continue to lend to households and businesses even in times of stress,” Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England’s deputy governor for financial stability, said in a news release on Friday.“The financial crisis demonstrated the long-lasting damage that can be caused when large banks become distressed and have to cut back lending to the economy,” he added. “These proposals are intended to reduce the risk of this happening again.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
