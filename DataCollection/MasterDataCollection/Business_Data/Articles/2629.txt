LONDON — A former UBS derivatives trader said on Thursday that he would fight an effort by the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain to bar him from the financial services industry for misconduct related to the setting of a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor.The trader, Arif Hussein, says the regulator ignored crucial evidence in the case and relied on information provided by UBS’s lawyers, who conducted an internal investigation into potential manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.Mr. Hussein has challenged the Financial Conduct Authority’s decision before the Upper Tribunal, an administrative court in Britain. The tribunal will determine whether the Financial Conduct Authority can proceed with the ban or direct it to reconsider the decision.“There was nothing approaching a proper investigation in this case, just a cozy deal done with a bank serving its own interests behind closed doors, without any independent scrutiny,” Mr. Hussein said in a news release on Thursday.AdvertisementThe Financial Conduct Authority claims that Mr. Hussein “acted recklessly and lacked integrity” by sharing information on his trading positions with individuals who were responsible for making submissions used to determine Libor.AdvertisementTo set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities. Libor is used to price more than $300 trillion in securities each year.Mr. Hussein “closed his mind to the risk” that the rate submitters at UBS would use his preferences to influence their Libor submissions with the aim of benefiting his trading positions, the Financial Conduct Authority said.He said on Thursday that he was directed by the bank to share his trading positions with colleagues in Zurich and only later learned that he was doing so with an individual responsible for making Libor submissions on occasion. He previously won an unfair dismissal case against UBS.“The F.C.A. says I ‘closed my eyes’ as to what the submitter would do with the information,” Mr. Hussein said in a statement. “This is absurd. It was UBS’s policy to ensure that its Libor submissions always benefited its own trading positions and reflected its commercial interests.”UBS declined to comment on Thursday.In a decision issued in January but made public only on Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority found that Mr. Hussein, 36, shared his preferences for where Libor should be set as it relates to the pound with one of the bank’s rate submitters, through private chats, over almost two months in 2009, despite knowing it would be improper to do so.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            The submitter would at times call Mr. Hussein’s preferences “special libors” in those chats, which ended when Mr. Hussein resigned from UBS in March 2009, the regulator said.The Financial Conduct Authority described Mr. Hussein as head of the bank’s British pound rates desk, but Mr. Hussein said on Thursday that he was a junior trader with no direct reports.AdvertisementMr. Hussein said he was ordered to disclose his exposure to Libor every day on an internal spreadsheet that could be viewed by individuals at UBS, including the Libor submitters. He said he would have faced disciplinary action if he had not uploaded the data.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for its prior conduct over the manipulation of the interest rates, including Libor.A version of this article appears in print on April 15, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Former Trader Fights Bar Over Libor Dealings.
