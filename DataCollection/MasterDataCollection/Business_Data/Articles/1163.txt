The United States dollar index, which tracks the dollar against other major currencies, fell 1.7 percent, a large move for the foreign exchange market. Nearly all that decline happened in the last two hours of trading.Many United States companies have been complaining that the appreciation of the dollar was eroding their earnings by making American exports less profitable.But a weaker dollar also tends to send commodity prices higher, which was a relief to investors as well because a plunge in the price of crude oil has been decimating profits at energy companies.
