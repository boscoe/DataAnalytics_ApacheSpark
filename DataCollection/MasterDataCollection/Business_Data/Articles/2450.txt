Cities like Denver; San Jose, Calif.; and Austin, Tex., are now among those with the best-performing labor markets, while places as varied as Las Vegas, Chicago and Detroit remain laggards.

Since its peak after the Great Recession, unemployment has fallen across the nation. But some major cities have improved much more than others. Detroit and Las Vegas have gained substantial numbers of jobs but are still below average, and employment has still not risen to its levels before the recession. Austin and San Antonio are the only cities where jobless rates have fallen below their prerecession levels.
