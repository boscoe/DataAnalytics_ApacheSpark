WASHINGTON —  Consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December as the cost of gasoline dropped and rents rose moderately — all signs of weak inflation that could indicate that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates in March.Other data on Wednesday showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month. The latest reports follow weaker numbers on retail sales, industrial production, exports, inventory and manufacturing surveys. All indicators suggest that there was a significant slowdown in economic growth at the end of 2015.Against the backdrop of renewed weakness in oil prices, which touched new lows on Wednesday, economists say the expected reversion to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is slowing.“The broad-based nature of the decline in inflation will hardly be encouraging news at the Fed, and if anything it is likely to temper their confidence in the outlook for inflation,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.

Last month, gasoline tumbled 3.9 percent after falling 2.4 percent in November. Food prices fell for a second straight month as meat, poultry, fish and egg prices posted their biggest declines since August 1979.The gain in the core C.P.I. was kept in check by moderate increases in rents and medical care costs. Rents rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in November.The slowdown in rental prices signals the loss of economic momentum, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. “That momentum moved millennials off of their parent’s couch and onto their own, but momentum may no longer be strong enough to put the same upward pressure on rents,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
