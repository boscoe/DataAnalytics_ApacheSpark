AbbVie followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie had exclusive contracts with payers like the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices.Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015. Hepatitis C infects an estimated 3.2 million Americans.The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck’s Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement.
