King of United States District Court in Los Angeles, call for the judge to declare “Happy Birthday” part of the public domain.The settlement would also grant $4.6 million in fees to the lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of independent artists and filmmakers who filed separate suits in 2013 that were later combined.“Happy Birthday,” which the suit calls “the world’s most popular song,” can be traced to another tune with the same melody but different lyrics: “Good Morning to All,” written by Mildred Hill and her sister Patty, a kindergarten teacher in Kentucky, which was published in 1893. Variations with the familiar birthday lyrics began to appear in the early 20th century, but their authorship was uncertain. Warner/Chappell had controlled the song since 1988, when it acquired the song’s last publisher.The “Happy Birthday” case was closely followed in the music industry and among copyright specialists in part because of the song’s popularity and the value of its royalties, which have been estimated at about $2 million a year. The suit included developments like the last-minute discovery of a yellowed songbook from 1922, which the plaintiffs’ lawyers called “a proverbial smoking gun” because it included a version of the popular birthday song without proper copyright notice.After the judge determined in September that Warner’s copyright was invalid, the parties were to go to trial. They announced in December that they had reached an agreement, the terms of which were confidential until the filing on Monday.Advertisement
