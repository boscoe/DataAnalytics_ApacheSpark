Centerview Partners, one of the top boutique investment banks around, has poached yet another senior deal maker to fill its ranks.The firm has hired Kenneth T. Berliner, a retail specialist who was most recently the president of Peter J. Solomon Company. An official announcement is expected soon.The addition of Mr. Berliner comes as Centerview continues to lay claim as one of the busiest and most successful boutique investment banks — which advise corporations on deals but shun trading and lending — at a time when such smaller firms have gained more and more prominence.(Centerview, along with Barclays, advised Johnson Controls in its merger with  Tyco.)At Peter J. Solomon Company, where he spent 23 years, Mr. Berliner advised on a range of transactions, including the proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot, Walgreen’s takeover of fellow drugstore chain Duane Reade and the $2.4 billion sale of GSI Commerce to eBay.AdvertisementHe has long known Robert A. Pruzan, the veteran deal maker who co-founded Centerview with Blair W. Effron.A spokeswoman for Peter J. Solomon Company said: “Ken left the firm last June and just completed his garden leave so we expected that he would have found a new challenge shortly after the new year. We are pleased for him as he joins Centerview Partners. Blair Effron and Bob Pruzan run a terrific firm and we wish him all the best.”AdvertisementNews of Mr. Berliner’s hiring was reported earlier by Fortune.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
