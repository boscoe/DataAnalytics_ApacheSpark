The pain for Chesapeake Energy began early on Monday, as its stock began to tumble. And kept falling.Shares of the beleaguered oil producer fell to as low as $1.51, with the tumble causing several trading halts, after the trade publication Debtwire reported that the company had hired restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis.The worry among investors was that Chesapeake was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as the low price of oil continues to weigh on the energy industry.The company’s shares have fallen 56 percent so far this year.Chesapeake itself has been considered financially weakened, burdened by a heavy debt load. Already, the driller has exchanged nearly $4 billion of its bonds into new debt.AdvertisementChesapeake finally put out a statement late Monday morning that Kirkland & Ellis had been one of its legal advisers since 2010 and was counseling the company in its financial restructuring efforts.But the oil driller took pains to note that it “currently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy.”Its shares rose slightly after the announcement, trading at $2.01 as of midday on Monday.AdvertisementYet analysts remain pessimistic about the company’s fortunes. It reported $10 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, compared to $1.8 billion in cash on hand. And it lost $4.7 billion in its most recent quarter, the third-consecutive quarterly loss.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
