The final hours of Travis Kalanick’s tenure as Uber’s longtime, aggressive chief executive came down to a Chicago hotel and an ultimatum by two investors.Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton of Benchmark, a venture capital firm that had a seat on the board of the ride-hailing company, flew out to hand-deliver a letter with a list of demands, according to The New York Times. At the top of the list: Resign before the end of the day.Here’s the full list of demands, per our Mike Isaac:
            1. resign2. build independent board3. board-led CEO search4. hire a CFO        Mr. Kalanick reached out to fellow board member Arianna Huffington. He haggled with Mr. Cohler and Mr. Fenton. And then, hours later and weary, he stepped down.One big lesson from Mr. Kalanick’s ouster: There are limits to how much deference will be paid to a visionary founder.AdvertisementRemember these pre-Uber situations:• Zenefits’ board ousted Parker Conrad amid a legal morass.• Zynga replaced Mark Pincus, twice.Founders may own super-voting shares, but they are not invulnerable.In other Uber news: • Bill Gurley, the Benchmark partner who led the move to oust Mr. Kalanick as chief executive, stepped down from the Uber board and will be replaced by Mr. Cohler. David Trujillo, the TPG Capital partner who led the private equity firm’s Uber investment, will take the seat vacated by David Bonderman after Mr. Bonderman made a sexist remark at a company meeting.• It should prompt some self-reflection in Silicon Valley, Farhad Manjoo writes: “What happened at Uber is an indictment of everyone who enabled Mr. Kalanick’s worst tendencies and practices.”Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He was there at the invitation of John Elkann, the Agnelli family scion who leads Exor, the investment group that owns a controlling stake in Fiat Chrysler. Mr. Elkann hosted a symposium on the future of the newspaper industry in celebration of the 150th anniversary of another Agnelli family property, the Italian paper, La Stampa.Given the focus on newspapers, Mr. Bezos wasn’t asked about Whole Foods. But he was perhaps the most open he had ever been about his ownership of The Washington Post.Advertisement“This is not a philanthropic endeavor,” he said. “For me, I really believe, a healthy newspaper that has an independent newsroom should be self-sustaining.” He added that while newspapers around the world feel challenged, “One of the first rules of business is ‘Complaining is not a strategy.’ You have to work with the world as you find it, not as you would have it be.”Good advice for any business.Also speaking on panels: Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation; Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company; Lionel Barber, the editor of The Financial Times; Jessica Lessin, the founder of The Information website; and DealBook’s own Andrew Ross Sorkin.(Also from the scene: Mr. Thomson said at the event that News Corp., which publishes The Wall Street Journal and The Times of London, is in advanced discussions about subscriptions to its content on Facebook.)China’s banking regulator ordered the country’s commercial banks to investigate loans made to some of the most aggressive overseas deal makers in recent years, reported The Wall Street Journal and Caixin, a Chinese news organization, citing people with knowledge of the matter.The regulator had asked lenders to conduct internal assessments of their credit risk exposure to acquisitive companies, Caixin reported.The companies in question include Anbang Insurance Group, HNA Group, Fosun International and Wanda Group. Shares in both Fosun and Wanda Films, the cinema unit of Wanda Group, sank on Thursday.Oscar winner. New father. Successful start-up founder.What began as a side project — sorry, “research” — by Mr. Clooney and his friend, Rande Gerber, became Casamigos, the tequila brand that the buddies have now sold to Diageo for up to $1 billion: $700 million upfront and as much as $300 million more if sales targets are reached over the next decade.Details of how much each of the three founders — the third is Mike Meldman, a real estate mogul — stand to make from the deal are unknown. But the return is almost certain to make Mr. Clooney one of the most successful celebrity investors around, ahead of angel investors like Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsangWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
