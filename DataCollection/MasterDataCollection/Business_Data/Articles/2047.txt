The government owned just over 9 percent of the company’s shares as of the beginning of December.Since Mr. Osborne announced plans in October for a retail offering, the share price of Lloyds has fallen 17 percent and is trading below the average of 73.6 pence a share that the British government paid for its original holding.Shares of Lloyds were down 1.5 percent at 63.96 pence at midday in London on Thursday.The British government is eager to terminate its ownership of the Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland, which received a £45 billion bailout.Mr. Osborne has pledged to sell £25 billion in R.B.S. shares over the next five years, even if the government has to sell some at a loss. The government owns about 73 percent of R.B.S. after it began winding down its stake last year.Advertisement
