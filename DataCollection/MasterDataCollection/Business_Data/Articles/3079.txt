WASHINGTON — The financial industry now has more information about why a court allowed MetLife to shed its “too big to fail” label last week, in a major setback for supporters of the Dodd-Frank Act.A federal judge ruled on March 30 that regulators failed to properly name the country’s biggest life insurer as “systemically important.” But the decision itself was under seal until it was made public on Thursday.The ruling shows that Judge Rosemary Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia was unimpressed with core aspects of the analysis underpinning the MetLife designation. The judge also found that regulators failed to properly account for the expected costs of heightened oversight under the designation.The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the government would appeal the district court’s decision.AdvertisementTreasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who leads the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees the health of the financial system, said in a statement earlier on Thursday that regulators planned to “continue defending vigorously the process and the integrity of F.S.O.C.’s work,” expressing confidence that the government will prevail.Advertisement“In overturning the conclusions of experienced financial regulators, the court imposed new requirements that Congress never enacted, and contradicted key policy lessons from the financial crisis,” Mr. Lew added.The opinion, however, contained an important silver lining for regulators.Judge Collyer threw out the insurer’s argument that it was ineligible for designation, which could give the council the opportunity to reissue the label if the government loses its appeal.The verdict is not that MetLife is immune from designation, said Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official, but instead rests on two arguments that the F.S.O.C. didn’t do enough work to merit the designation.Judge Collyer determined that the regulatory council fell short in its designation process in several areas.The Dodd-Frank Act provides regulators with two standards for determining whether a firm is “systemically important,” and while regulators chose to invoke the first standard — that “material financial distress” at a firm “could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States” — against MetLife, its reasoning did not hold up, according to the judge.Under that standard, the judge found that the council failed to assess the likelihood of MetLife finding itself on the brink of bankruptcy and concluded that analysts did not go far enough in explaining how the company’s hypothetical distress would undermine the financial system as a whole.Regulators failed to account for why they “abandoned the guidance and refused to evaluate MetLife’s vulnerability to material financial distress,” the judge wrote in the opinion, adding that the designation “hardly adhered to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife’s threat to U.S. financial stability.”AdvertisementTaken together, she called the departures from the Dodd-Frank law and regulators’ own guidance “fatally flawed.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Eugene Scalia, son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and a lawyer for MetLife in this case, was the architect of some of those earlier lawsuits.“There is no doubt that F.S.O.C. refused to consider the costs” of its decision, and it did so “purposefully,” the judge wrote.A spokesman for MetLife, Christopher Stern, said, “We remain pleased with the U.S. District Court’s decision.”Analysts for Piper Jaffray have estimated that $2.5 billion to $3 billion of capital could be returned to shareholders or invested in other ways as result of MetLife shedding the too-big-to-fail label, which mandates higher capital requirements and greater scrutiny.It is unclear how the ruling may affect the other three nonbank companies that regulators have designated as “systemically important”: the American International Group, Prudential Financial and General Electric’s financing arm.General Electric filed a request with regulators to repeal its label last week, a day after the MetLife decision came down, arguing that it has greatly pruned its financial assets and considerably reduced its threat to the system.Spokesmen for both Prudential and A.I.G. declined to comment on Thursday.The companies may use the opinion as evidence when their designations are up for annual review in front of the council.Advertisement“I think this ruling opens the door for other systemically significant companies to basically wiggle their way out,” said Mark Williams, a lecturer at Boston University and former bank examiner at the Federal Reserve.MetLife’s win has provided fresh ammunition for opponents of the Obama administration and the Dodd-Frank law in Congress. House Republicans hailed the decision last week, calling for greater transparency at Treasury and the F.S.O.C.The decision is a blow to supporters of Dodd-Frank, who point out that large, interconnected financial institutions, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, nearly brought down the financial system in the fall of 2008.“I would question whether we’ve really learned the lessons of Lehman,” Mr. Williams said. “The fact that there’s been a legal overturn doesn’t mean the risk no longer exists — it’s still there.”A version of this article appears in print on April 8, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Rejected Regulators’ Analysis That MetLife Was Too Big to Fail.
