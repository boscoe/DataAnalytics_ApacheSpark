Europe’s media industry is going through another shake-up.On Friday, the French giant Vivendi, which owns the Universal Music Group, said that it had entered a share-swap agreement with Mediaset, an Italian media company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, in which both companies would receive a 3.5 percent stake in each other.As part of the deal, Vivendi will also acquire Mediaset’s pay-TV arm — which focuses primarily on offering Italians premium sports and movie content — valued at roughly $850 million.The move will allow Vivendi, which also owns Canal Plus, the French pay television company, to compete more directly with rivals like Netflix, which recently announced aggressive global expansion plans, and the premium broadcaster Sky, which is partly owned by 21st Century Fox.“The deal between Vivendi and Mediaset is a potential game changer,” Paolo Pescatore, a media analyst at CCS Insight, said in a statement. “Vivendi is now positioning itself as a content powerhouse in Europe.”AdvertisementBy joining forces with Mediaset — Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster — Vivendi hopes to move one step closer to creating a Pan-European media company that can tap into people’s seemingly insatiable desire to watch movies and television programs and listen to songs on their smartphones and other mobile devices.AdvertisementThis deal, according to the companies, will help them develop a partnership for media content like movies and television programs, and potential new ways to transmit these programs to customers over the Internet.As part of Vivendi’s efforts to expand its media empire, Vincent Bolloré, Vivendi’s powerful chairman, has pushed to sell the company’s telecommunications assets in France and elsewhere to raise much-needed capital.He has also bought stakes in a number of leading video-game companies, including Ubisoft, the French company behind the popular Assassins Creed franchise, to expand the company’s reach across the media industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Telefónica, the Spanish telecom company, has an 11 percent stake in the division, which Mediaset must now acquire as part of the deal.Vivendi’s plan includes producing more original content, particularly for Europeans who are looking for movies or television programs produced in their native languages. This lack of local content, according to media experts, could hamper Netflix’s expansion plans beyond the United States.This week, for instance, Vivendi unveiled Studio Plus, a new service to produce video content primarily for tablet and smartphone users.The company’s latest push into Italy comes soon after Vivendi acquired an almost 25 percent stake in Telecom Italia, the country’s former telecom monopoly.While Vivendi has said its stake is aimed at taking advantage of Europe’s consolidating telecom industry, the company has also moved to strengthen its position on Telecom Italia’s board, including the recent ousting of the company’s chief executive, Marco Patuano.Analysts say Vivendi’s push to gain greater control over Telecom Italia, which may soon announce 15,000 layoffs at a time of cutthroat competition in the country’s broadband market, could provide the company with an opportunity to consolidate its mounting presence in both Italy’s telecom and media industries.AdvertisementSuch deals — similar to Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal — could offer Europe’s carriers and media companies new revenue opportunities, as many still struggle to generate stable earnings because of competition for mobile and broadband customers across the 28-member European Union.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
