Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is recalling almost 505,000 2011-16 Dodge Chargers, including about 442,000 in the United States, because the vehicle might fall off the jack when a tire is being changed, according to a report by the automaker posted on Saturday on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The problem is that the part of the vehicle’s body that rests on the jack could bend, allowing the vehicle to slide off, the report said.Fiat Chrysler will supply owners with two wheel chocks, which will be installed with the vehicle’s spare tire, and draw attention to a page in the owner’s manual on how the chocks should be placed at the front and back of one tire to keep the vehicle from rolling. The automaker is aware of three minor injuries, a spokesman, Eric Mayne, said in an email.In addition to the vehicles being recalled in the United States, about 19,000 are being recalled in Canada, almost 5,000 in Mexico and almost 39,000 outside North America.In a separate action, also posted Saturday on the safety agency’s website, Graco Children’s Products said it was recalling about 15,000 child safety seats. In its report, Graco said the Extend2Fit Convertible models had incorrect instructions that could result in the child sitting in the wrong position — like being reclined instead of upright. “That could affect the safety of the child in an accident,” Graco said in the report.Fiat Chrysler described its recall as voluntary, but once an automaker is aware of a safety problem, it must inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of its plan for a recall or face civil fines.A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2016, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Dodges Recalled Because of Risks in Changing Tires.
