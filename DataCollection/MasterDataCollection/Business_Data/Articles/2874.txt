Claiming that she has been disinherited out of $6 million and potentially $1 billion more, the granddaughter of the mogul Sumner M. Redstone has joined the lawsuit challenging his mental competence, asserting that he has been unduly influenced by his daughter.Keryn Redstone, Mr. Redstone’s 34-year-old granddaughter, filed court documents in Massachusetts on Tuesday, officially aligning herself with Mr. Redstone’s two longtime confidants who were ousted from the trust that will control his companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. The beneficiaries of that trust, now valued at more than $5 billion, include Keryn Redstone and Mr. Redstone’s four other grandchildren.The development increases the tension in an already intense corporate and family battle that includes court fights in three states. Earlier this year, Keryn Redstone stood in opposition to her aunt, Shari Redstone, when she aligned with Manuela Herzer, a former companion and onetime romantic partner of Mr. Redstone, in a separate suit challenging his competency.It is not clear how the development could affect the on-again, off-again attempts to settle the legal battles over the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone’s $40 billion media empire, which are being fought in Massachusetts, California and Delaware. While the other parties in the dispute could reach an agreement separate from Keryn Redstone, she now is a plaintiff in the Massachusetts suit and her involvement could make settlement discussions more difficult.AdvertisementHanging in the balance is not only the Redstone family fortunes but also the fate of Mr. Redstone’s business empire. Through the private theater chain company National Amusements, Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS, two of the world’s largest entertainment companies.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.            Keryn Redstone is insisting that she will not settle without the inclusion of a deal for Ms. Herzer, according to a person with knowledge of her thinking. Last year, Mr. Redstone revoked plans to leave Ms. Herzer $50 million and his $20 million Los Angeles mansion.So far, attempts to resolve the tangled dispute out of court have failed. Just last week, settlement talks between National Amusements and Viacom executives fell apart after a Massachusetts judge scheduled an October trial on the matter, according to three people briefed on the discussions.AdvertisementThe potential deal included plans for Philippe P. Dauman to leave his position as chief executive as Viacom and for Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom’s chief operating officer, to step in as the interim chief executive of the company, these people said. It also included changes to the Viacom board.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Yet the prospect of the dispute going to trial in multiple states could draw the various parties back to the negotiating table.Figuring out a settlement would preserve the privacy and the dignity of Mr. Redstone, whose health is failing. It also would prevent the airing of the sometimes bitter relationship between Mr. Redstone and his daughter, with whom he has recently reconciled. And it could provide a path for Mr. Dauman to exit the company less contentiously and still well compensated.In the suit filed on Tuesday, Keryn Redstone depicts her aunt as a ruthless villain who kidnapped her ailing father Mr. Redstone and used him as a puppet to take control of his media empire. Along the way, Keryn Redstone was replaced as a trustee.Keryn Redstone states that the recent appointment of new trustees puts her inheritance at stake, as they will act at the behest of Shari Redstone instead of following her grandfather’s succession plans.“It will only be a matter of time, if it has not already occurred, that Shari carries out her longtime vendetta against Keryn and eliminates her as a beneficiary, or substantially reduces her inheritance, under the trust,” lawyers for Keryn Redstone said in the suit.The suit also suit claims that Shari Redstone manipulated her father into writing Keryn Redstone out of his personal trust and removing her $6 million bequest.A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A version of this article appears in print on August 3, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Redstone’s Granddaughter Joins in Suit Against Him.
