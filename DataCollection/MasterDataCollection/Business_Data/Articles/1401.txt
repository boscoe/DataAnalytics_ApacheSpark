Johnson & Johnson has resumed acquisition talks with Actelion Pharmaceuticals, the $20 billion Swiss biopharmaceutical company, after announcing just last week that it was severing discussions over a deal.Johnson & Johnson and Actelion confirmed on Wednesday that they had entered into “exclusive negotiations,” according to separate news releases from each company. They both cautioned that there was no assurance that an actual transaction would be signed as a result of these talks.The news comes after various reports indicated that Actelion was in advanced talks to be acquired by the French drug maker Sanofi.Actelion is known for its treatments and products for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or high blood pressure in the lungs. Sanofi had recently lost to Pfizer in a competitive bid over Medivation, a developer of oncology treatments. Sanofi has been pursuing acquisitions to spur growth, but it has had limited success this year.AdvertisementActelion confirmed its initial discussions with Johnson & Johnson in a statement on Nov. 25. But a few weeks later, Johnson & Johnson said in a release that it ended talks with Actelion because the two were unable to reach an agreement that would “create adequate value for its shareholders.”Soon after, Actelion released a statement confirming that Johnson & Johnson had withdrawn from their discussions but that it was speaking with “another party” about a transaction. The Wall Street Journal reported that Sanofi had swooped in and was having takeover discussions with Actelion that would value the company as high as $30 billion.AdvertisementAn email requesting comment from Sanofi was not immediately returned.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
