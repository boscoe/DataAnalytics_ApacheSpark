Nielsen announced Monday that it would start incorporating set-top-box viewing data into its TV ratings system after striking a multiyear agreement with the satellite provider Dish Network.Through the partnership, Nielsen will receive anonymous viewing data from millions of households with Dish service. The data will be incorporated into Nielsen’s local TV ratings, where the company has used unreliable paper diaries to measure viewing. Nielsen also plans to use the data for a broader set of measurement services.The deal represents a broader push by the 93-year-old Nielsen to evolve its TV ratings system, upon which some $70 billion in advertising dollars in the United States are traded each year. Nielsen has faced harsh criticism in recent years from TV and advertising executives who have called it antiquated and inaccurate in the digital viewing age.The agreement also comes as Nielsen faces more competition following the $768 million merger of the rival media measurement companies comScore and Rentrak, which use data from set-top boxes to track what people watch on television.A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Nielsen Will Add Viewing on Set-Top Boxes to Ratings.
