For Italians, who have seen 63 governments in 70 years, the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was hardly shocking.Outside of the country, the mood is not so sanguine.Though financial markets eventually took the news of Mr. Renzi’s resignation in stride, his pending departure has inserted yet another major variable into the global economy.Italians’ rejection of a reformist leader underlined worries about the country’s commitment to the euro, as well as its banking system, which holds 360 billion euros, or about $385 billion, in suspect debt.Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a troubled lender, was set to receive €5 billion from private investors. Now, because of the political upheaval, senior bankers have told the bank to prepare for a state bailout, The Financial Times reported.Advertisement“Whatever solution is found for Monte dei Paschi, I believe there is a significant risk of contagion to other Italian banks in particular,” Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, told The Financial Times. (Neil Unmack of Breakingviews lists four banking challenges for the next prime minister.)AdvertisementFor those outside Italy, it is hardly shocking to see yet another crisis in a southern European country that threatens the 19-country eurozone.The difference? This one comes as anti-European Union sentiment is spreading.“This is a crisis that strikes at the absolute core of the European Union in a way even ‘Brexit’ does not,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.“The U.K. was always one foot in and one foot out,” he said. “Italy is a founding member state, fully integrated into the union’s political and economic structure. This is existential for the E.U.”President-elect Donald J. Trump has lined up some big names for his job creation advisory panel, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Mary Barra of General Motors.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Elliott received copies of at least some of the offers.On Tuesday, a special committee of Avianca’s board is expected to meet to decide whether to accept a bid or proceed with a new round of bids.• Goldman Sachs holds its two-day United States Financial Services Conference in New York. Speakers include chief executives of big investment banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and asset managers like Blackstone.• The Commerce Department will report data on the trade balance in October. Most analysts are expecting the trade deficit to widen to roughly $42 billion from its $36.4 billion level in September.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
