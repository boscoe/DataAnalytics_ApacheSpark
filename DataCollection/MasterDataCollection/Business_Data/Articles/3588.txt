The Shenzhen composite index ended 3.8 percent higher, and the broad CSI 300 stock index finished 2.1 percent higher.“I would caution against any near-term prediction, because the market has been very volatile,” said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at Bank of Communications International. “But we should have a weakish rebound from here.”“You tend to have people try to come in and do some bottom fishing,” he added, referring to bargain-hunting investors.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.1 percent in the first minutes of trading on Thursday, and the Dow Jones industrial average was flat.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of eurozone blue chips, was down 1.6 percent in early afternoon trading, while the FTSE 100 in London was off 1 percent.While Chinese stocks had at least a one-day respite, Japanese shares continued their recent slide. The Nikkei 225-share index was down as much as 4.3 percent but pared losses late in the afternoon to finish down 2.7 percent.The Japanese market is under pressure on two fronts, analysts said, with broad concerns about global growth rates compounded by a rise in the value of the yen.Traders have flocked to the Japanese currency as a haven during the recent turmoil, pushing up its exchange rate against the dollar by about 5 percent since December. That has undercut one of the main supports for Japanese share prices: The cheaper the yen, the bigger the benefits for global manufacturing giants like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn most of their revenues abroad in foreign currencies.“The main reason Japanese shares are falling so hard is the exchange rate,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, a strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Asset Management. “Currencies in other Asian countries and emerging markets are falling, but people are buying yen as a hedge against risk.”In addition, traders said, Middle Eastern investors who have been hit by the fall in oil prices are selling parts of their shareholdings in large foreign markets like Japan.“The biggest markets by capitalization are the U.S., the U.K. and Japan, so if oil money is selling, that is where it will come from,” said Chihiro Ota, general manager at SMBC NikkoSecurities, a Japanese brokerage house. “Sell orders from oil producing countries were front-and-center today.”In Jakarta, Indonesia, where attacks killed at least two civilians, stocks were down 0.5 percent at the close. The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, also weakened after the capital was hit in what the authorities said was a terrorist attack, but it strengthened through the day and was 0.5 percent higher in the evening.United States stocks are in the zone of a correction, or a decline of 10 percent or more from a recent high. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in the United States dropped 2.5 percent on Wednesday, despite two days of gains that suggested that confidence might be returning after a tumultuous start to the year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent.Investors’ fears have been compounded by the prospect of a continued increase in interest rates in the United States, which could tighten financial conditions and make exports less competitive by strengthening the dollar. This has also squeezed emerging markets, which have been simultaneously hit by falling commodity prices.Oil prices have also continued to sink, as demand from China has slowed and oil-producing countries have continued to flood the markets. Analysts have said they expect prices to continue sliding, with some even arguing that a $20 barrel is possible. The weakness has spread to other commodities, as prices have fallen because of less demand from China.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Jonathan Soble and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement
