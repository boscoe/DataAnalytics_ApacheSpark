The declines on Monday follow what has been a remarkable rally in November since Donald J. Trump won the United States presidential election. Investors have made big bets that Mr. Trump, with a Republican-led Congress, will push to deregulate energy and banking and cut taxes, which could lead to stronger economic growth.Advertisement“The economic and equity market backdrop was already improving before the election,” Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, wrote in a note to investors. “Trump’s victory and the Republican sweep provided a catalyst for investors to ratchet up their optimism.”AdvertisementThe Russell 2000, an index of smaller companies lost, 1.3 percent on Monday, ending a 15-day winning streak. That was the longest winning streak for the index in 20 years, which rose roughly 11.6 percent this month alone.Banks also fell more than the rest of the market, with the financial sector of the S.&P. 500-stock index falling 1.4 percent. Banks have surged since the election on speculation that the Trump administration would roll back some regulations put into place after the financial crisis.Investors have also pulled out of the bond market, betting that higher economic growth will also lead to higher inflation, something the United States economy has had little of since the financial crisis.
