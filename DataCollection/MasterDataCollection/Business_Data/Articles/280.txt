LONDON — A British financial regulator barred a former trader at Deutsche Bank from the country’s financial services industry on Wednesday, after he pleaded guilty last year to criminal charges in the United States over a scheme to manipulate the global benchmark interest rate known as Libor.A half-decade investigation into the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, has led to billions of dollars in fines and has damaged the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks, including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS. Deutsche Bank itself agreed in April to pay $2.5 billion in penalties to resolve an inquiry by British and American authorities into the manipulation of Libor. The bank’s British subsidiary also agreed to plead guilty in the matter.On Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority said it had barred the former Deutsche Bank trader, Michael R. Curtler, a British citizen, from the industry for “lacking honesty and integrity.” He pleaded guilty in the United States in October to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.In a charging document, the United States Justice Department accused Mr. Curtler of engaging in a conspiracy to manipulate Libor, the average rate at which banks can borrow from one another, from 2003 to 2011. Mr. Curtler awaits sentencing.Advertisement“Mr. Curtler has admitted engaging in dishonest conduct in making” Libor submissions in dollars, Mark Steward, the director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority, said in a news release. “Dishonesty must disqualify him from U.K. financial services. Consequently, he must be prohibited.”AdvertisementTo set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            The British regulator said that Mr. Curtler, who worked at Deutsche Bank from 1993 to 2012, received requests from traders at the German bank to alter his submissions on Libor as they related to the dollar. The requests were made to benefit the trading positions of the bank and individual traders, it added.The regulator said that Mr. Curtler had altered his Libor submissions based on those requests and had solicited requests from traders regarding their desires on Libor.Mr. Curtler is the third person to be barred by the Financial Conduct Authority over Libor manipulation: Lee Stewart and Paul Robson, two former traders at the Dutch lender Rabobank, received bans last year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In December, a British appeals court reduced his sentence to 11 years in prison from 14 years.In January, six former brokers were acquitted of charges that they had helped Mr. Hayes manipulate rates.Both cases were brought by the Serious Fraud Office in Britain. A third trial in London related to rate rigging is expected this year.The first trial in the United States of people accused of rigging Libor ended in the conviction in November of two former London-based traders.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
