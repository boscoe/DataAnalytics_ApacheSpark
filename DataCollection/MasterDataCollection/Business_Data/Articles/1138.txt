A California journalist was sentenced on Wednesday to two years in federal prison for helping to hack the website of The Los Angeles Times in 2010.The journalist, Matthew Keys, was convicted in October of providing the hacking group Anonymous with a user name and password to log in to computers owned by the Tribune Company, parent company of The Times.A federal indictment said that Mr. Keys, 29, had encouraged the hackers, with whom he worked in December 2010, to log in to a Tribune server “to make unauthorized changes to websites” and “to damage computer systems” owned by the company.The hackers changed the Times headline “Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package” to “Pressure Builds in House to Elect CHIPPY 1337,” a reference to another hacking group.AdvertisementMr. Keys previously was a web producer at KTXL Fox 40, a Sacramento television station owned by Tribune. Federal prosecutors in Sacramento said that Mr. Keys, of Vacaville, Calif., was a disgruntled worker striking back at his former employer.AdvertisementAccording to court documents, Mr. Keys changed the access credentials of Fox 40 employees, interfering with their ability to access company servers, and obtained email addresses for Fox 40 viewers, to whom he sent disparaging emails about the company.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The charges had shocked the social media circles where he was considered a wunderkind of new media. He was named one of Time’s 140 best Twitter feeds. The indictment also sparked protests against the 1984 law under which he was charged, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.In an essay posted on Medium on Wednesday, Mr. Keys wrote that “the past three years have been exceptionally challenging — for me personally and for my professional career as a journalist.”He added: “I am innocent, and I did not ask for this fight. Nonetheless, I hope that our combined efforts help bring about positive change to rules and regulations that govern our online conduct.”He also posted his reaction to the sentence on Twitter:
            2 years. We plan on filing a motion to stay the sentence.        An earlier version of this article misstated when Matthew Keys was a deputy social media editor at Reuters. He held that position at the time he was charged in 2013 with helping Anonymous hack The Los Angeles Times’ website, not when the hacking occurred, in 2010.A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2016, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Journalist Gets 2 Years for Assistance to Hackers.
