The Fairfax Financial boss Prem Watsa has drafted an airtight policy for the insurance company’s $4.9 billion deal to buy its Swiss rival Allied World. And BlackBerry, where Mr. Watsa is both the lead director and a major investor, is trying to parlay its smartphone history into hands-free driving success.Fairfax’s offer for Allied, unveiled on Sunday, looks anodyne on the surface. The 18 percent premium to combine two players in the property and casualty market is hardly over the top. But Allied will continue to operate as a stand-alone company, so there are no planned cost savings. Fairfax’s pitch is that the deal will diversify its earnings — and that both firms have good track records.Mr. Watsa has taken some of the sting out of the premium tail for Fairfax investors: Half of the $900 million cash component will come from a special dividend Allied will pay to its own shareholders. Governance, though, is more troubling. Mr. Watsa owns 43 percent of Fairfax but is not excluding himself from the vote to approve the deal. It would be a more hands-off decision if he followed the example of Elon Musk, who earlier this year left it to the other shareholders to decide whether Tesla Motors and SolarCity should merge.Fairfax also wants written support from other big owners to tip approval past the 50 percent needed, perhaps avoiding a vote involving all shareholders. The company has also left itself the flexibility to switch most of the financing for the deal to cash, which would remove the need for any vote at all.Mr. Watsa’s fingerprints may not be as visible in BlackBerry’s decision to invest more in autonomous cars, but he runs the board and is a crucial voice at the once high-flying tech company. Back in 2013 he made an offer to buy it, a Fairfax investment firm is the second-largest shareholder, and Fairfax is BlackBerry’s “leading lender,” according to its chief executive, John Chen.Driverless-car technology is not an absurd road for BlackBerry to follow. Its QNX division already has some expertise and has Ford Motor as a client. The problem is that there are plenty of more specialized, deeper-pocketed companies on the autonomous bandwagon already. Mr. Watsa may yet have to take a firmer grip at BlackBerry, too.Advertisement
