General ticket sales for Beyoncé’s “Formation” world tour don’t open until next week, but advance sales have provided a taste of what to expect: lots of emotion — good and bad — pouring out on social media.And it’s not just Beyoncé. The ticket race for any high-profile tour — Adele’s, for instance, or the final Grateful Dead performances last year — reliably prompts four stages of emotional outbursts online.First, excitement at the prospect of attending the show. That usually turns to frustration once ticket sales actually open. And then the final two stages diverge. One group secures tickets and is elated; the other, denied their chance, is filled with rage and sadness.For this, we can thank a mix of fan demand and ticket scalpers, who are both aided and thwarted by new technology. Bots can help scalpers scoop up huge quantities of tickets, leaving sellers trying to identify and block the unscrupulous purchases. And leaving thousands of individual fans shut out.AdvertisementThe excitement stage:
            OMG BEYONCE'S GOING ON TOUR REPEAT BEYONCE'S GOING ON TOUR ....NEED MONEY NOW NEED IT        
            Guys.... She's going on a world tour. !!!        
            YALL IM HYPERVENTILATING, I NEED TO SEE BEYONCÉ AGAIN ON TOUR . OMG IM DYING        It’s not clear whether the Twitter reaction below is to Beyoncé’s tour announcement or just to watching her perform at the Super Bowl halftime show (both would be valid), but the excitement stage could also look like this:
            I can't I can't I'm pacing back and forth at my parents because I can't believe Beyoncé just did that        Later, that excitement might turn to frustration. At this point, ticket sales have usually just opened, whether it’s a presale — as was the case with Beyoncé on Tuesday — or a general sale. The rage is often directed at Ticketmaster, which bills itself as the world’s largest ticket store.AdvertisementSome people plea with Ticketmaster to help.
@Ticketmaster Trying to buy @Beyonce tickets that show up avail but keep getting an error. Can you help? pic.twitter.com/Wu6cFJ8Pz1 Others direct their pleas to a higher power.
            Been on @Ticketmaster to get @Beyonce tickets since 9 am and nothing Lordt help me        Some people are relatively calm about it all.
@Ticketmaster trying to buy Beyoncé tickets online and keeps saying unable to process my request for the last 3 hours. What's going on?        Emoji can skillfully convey the resultant mixture of sadness and anger from coping with stalled requests, spinning dials and other website woes.
            So I tried getting Beyoncé tickets, and I can't!!!! It's not letting me confirm my purchase        The later stages are where people diverge. For the group of people who do snag tickets, the roller coaster of emotions ends joyously, even if the purchase requires some sacrifices.
            TICKETMASTER WONT LET ME BUY BEYONCE TICKETS        
            I got the Beyoncé tickets! *doesn't eat for a month*        But for those who aren’t successful in their ticket quest, the outrage is palpable.
            Ticketmaster didn't seem to be prepared for #beyonce. Codes. Amex. Nothing helped me get tickets. Why did they even bother with presale?        
#Beyoncé tickets would have been better sold by a crack head in Central Park... Real fans would have gotten a chance at tickets today ... 1        
            1 cont. Instead a convenient amount of re sales tickets pop up; people who were not real fans and now making a buck        Tickets being purchased unfairly and resold at a markup isn’t a new problem, but new technology has changed the game by creating legitimate online marketplaces — Ticketmaster allows resales on its website, and StubHub is a popular alternative.And the game can feel absurdly unfair. Take, for instance, the time when free tickets for an appearance by Pope Francis were resold for thousands of dollars. The issue has caught the attention of the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who released a report in January following a three-year investigation of the online ticketing market.For its part, Ticketmaster continues to develop technology to identify the bots scooping up large blocks of tickets.“The battle against bots is an arms race,” said Joe Berchtold, the chief operating officer of Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster. “It’s like phishing: continuing escalation on each side.”AdvertisementThe security checkpoint most people recognize as CAPTCHA, which once ask people to retype hard-to-read letters and numbers to prove they were not bots, now just asks Ticketmaster customers to click a box.Though that tool might seem easier to fool, Mr. Berchtold says the more advanced technology is actually looking for other signals of humanity like “the way a mouse moves across a screen.”What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ticketmaster can cancel secondary transactions if they find out a bot made the original purchase, but Mr. Berchtold said, “The challenge is in finding out that it was a bot.”For those hoping to buy Beyoncé tickets when they go on sale to the general public on Tuesday, be ready to compete with millions of other fans. When Adele tickets went on sale in December, Ticketmaster was flooded with nine million people seeking about 400,000 tickets.“And Beyoncé is such a fantastic artist, there are more people who want to see her than there are seats to be sold,” Mr. Berchtold said.But at least there’s one more chance to avoid this outcome:
