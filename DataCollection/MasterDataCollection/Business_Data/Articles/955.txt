To the Editor:Gretchen Morgenson’s column “A Win for a Whistle-Blower” (Fair Game, Nov. 27) captures the retaliation that employees who try to stop wrongdoing by their employers often face.The federal government and many states have gradually added laws that encourage whistle-blowers to report fraud to the government by offering them job protection and rewards as well as confidentiality in some instances. As a lawyer for whistle-blowers, I have seen firsthand the powerful impact these laws have had.But existing whistle-blower programs generally apply only if a company is defrauding the government or there are significant securities, commodity or tax violations. Whistle-blowers who expose consumer frauds often do not have the same options.Legislators should create programs that encourage company insiders to provide enforcement agencies with information about consumer frauds. Whistle-blowers who fight for consumers should not have to battle on their own.Erika A.
