The figures, though, exceeded analysts’ expectations.Profit rose to $1.24 billion, or 28 cents a share, up from $770 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, Coke’s earnings were 38 cents a share, a penny more than analysts had predicted.“Our fourth-quarter performance was a testament to the action we took as the company continued to deliver solid pricing and unit case volume growth,” Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, said in a news release.Like many other companies that report their earnings in dollars, Coca-Cola said foreign currency translation had sliced 10 percentage points off its per-share earnings in the fourth quarter.Weakness internationally, where economies in several of Coke’s major markets are slowing, crimped the company’s performance and offset volume growth of 3 percent in North America.In 2015, Coca-Cola’s sales fell to $44.3 billion, down 4 percent, compared with $46 billion a year earlier. Profit for the year rose to $7.4 billion, a 3 percent gain over $7.1 billion in 2014.Advertisement
