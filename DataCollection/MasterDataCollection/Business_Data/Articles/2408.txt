The German industrial giant Bayer raised its all-cash takeover bid for Monsanto on Thursday, turning up the heat in its pursuit of the American agricultural company.In a news release, Bayer said that it had increased its offer to $125 a share from $122 a share.Bayer’s new offer — still the largest takeover bid by a German company — comes after weeks of discussions between the two companies, after Bayer went public with its offer.The merger would combine Monsanto, famous for its genetically modified crop seeds, and Bayer, a maker of a wide array of pesticides, as well as aspirin. Putting the two together could create an agricultural one-stop shop, one with annual sales of $67 billion.Monsanto rejected Bayer’s initial bid and reportedly has held discussions with another big chemical maker, BASF.Advertisement“We are convinced that this transaction is the best opportunity available to provide Monsanto shareholders with highly attractive, immediate and certain value,” Werner Baumann, Bayer’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Bayer is fully committed to pursuing this transaction.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
