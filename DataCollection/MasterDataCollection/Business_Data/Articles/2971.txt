“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty.”WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Thursday it was too soon to predict the economic impact of Donald J. Trump’s election as the next president of the United States.Markets have rallied on optimism that Mr. Trump, in concert with Republicans in Congress, would cut taxes and increase federal spending on road-building and the military, measures that might stimulate economic growth.Ms. Yellen, who has repeatedly called for Congress to join the Fed in its efforts to lift the economy from prolonged doldrums, suggested the celebrations were premature.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Ms. Yellen said in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, her first public comments since the election. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty.”AdvertisementShe added, “We will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook as the policy outlook becomes clearer.”AdvertisementMr. Trump’s election has not altered the Fed’s short-term plans. Ms. Yellen made clear in her testimony that the central bank remained likely to raise its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting, in mid-December.“The evidence we’ve seen since we met in November is consistent with our expectation of strengthening growth and an improving labor market,” Ms. Yellen said. “I do think the economy is making very good progress toward our goals.”A rate increase, she said, “could well become appropriate relatively soon.”Ms. Yellen also set to rest questions about her own plans. Her term as chairwoman ends in February 2018. “It is fully my intention to serve out my term,” she said.
                Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.            The Fed has prepared markets in recent months for the likelihood of an increase in its benchmark interest rate in December. At a meeting two weeks ago, the Fed’s policy-making body, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, found the case for a rate increase had strengthened but said officials were awaiting “some further evidence.”Investors put that chance above 90 percent Thursday, according to a measure derived from asset prices by CME Group.“Chair Yellen struck a reasonably — but still somewhat subdued — positive tone on the economy, and her words will be seen as signaling a high likelihood that the F.O.M.C. will be tightening policy at next month’s meeting,” wrote Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.The Fed has not raised its benchmark interest rate since December, leaving it in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent. The low level is intended to encourage borrowing and risk-taking, driving faster economic growth. Several times this year, the Fed has suggested it might raise rates, only to pull back over concerns about the fragility of the economy.AdvertisementBut the Fed’s outlook has brightened in recent months as evidence has rolled in that the economy, on most measures, is in its best shape in years.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

She noted, among other things, that soybean exports had surged in recent months.The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in October, and inflation has increased modestly.And Republicans could provide a fresh jolt to economic growth. Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, cited a “growing consensus” that there is a need for fiscal stimulus, like tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and regulatory reforms. “The past seven years have clearly taught us that low interest rates alone cannot cure an ailing economy,” Mr. Coats said.He added, however, that Congress needed to remain “mindful” of the relatively high level of the federal debt. And, in a preview of the role reversal that is likely to occur in the next Congress, Democrats on the committee chided Republicans for their spending plans.
                Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.            “I am interested to see how President Trump’s infrastructure plan can be reconciled with past Republican opposition to fiscal stimulus,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat and the ranking party member of the committee.Interestingly, Republicans made little mention of their various proposals to rewrite the Fed’s operating instructions to limit future economic stimulus campaigns. The only mentions of such plans, a staple of Fed hearings in recent years, came from Democrats.Ms. Maloney warned that Republican proposals would “lead to disaster.” She also noted such a push might not play well in the Midwestern states where voters turned to Mr. Trump in part because of his promises to revive their economic fortunes.“I’m not sure that people in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states would respond well to that suggestion,” she said dryly.Democrats also asked Ms. Yellen to address Republican proposals to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 legislation that overhauled financial regulation after the 2008 financial crisis.Advertisement“I certainly would not want to see all the improvements we’ve put in place, I would not want to see the clock turned back,” she said.Ms. Yellen offered a now-familiar assessment of the choice facing the Fed in December.On one hand, Ms. Yellen said, there was room for improvement. “While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely,” Ms. Yellen said, “there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market.”She noted that stronger growth was pulling some Americans back into the labor force.She cautioned, however, that the Fed did not want to wait “too long.” Monetary policy exerts gradual influence on economic conditions; the full effect of an interest-rate increase plays out over several years. And some Fed officials are increasingly concerned that the central bank needs to start moving now, or else it will need to raise rates more quickly in coming years.Ms. Yellen also acknowledged a related concern that low interest rates were encouraging imprudent speculation. “Holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long,” she said, “could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.”Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumA version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yellen Says Election Has Not Affected Interest Rate Plan.
