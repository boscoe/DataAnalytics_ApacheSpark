LONDON — British regulators said on Thursday that people engaged in high-frequency or algorithmic trading would be subject to newly completed rules intended to bring more accountability to the financial industry.The regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority, said that the new certification rules would apply to anyone engaging in so-called wholesale banking activities at banks, building societies and certain regulated investment firms. That would include traders who use lightning-fast computer systems and software to profit from small movements in stock prices.They would be subject to the new rules starting in September.The new measures, part of a broader certification program in Britain, would require firms to assess the fitness of people to serve in those positions; the firms would ultimately be accountable to regulators if they are not.“We are determined to embed a culture of personal responsibility within the banking sector,” Tracey McDermott, the acting chief executive of the authority, said in a news release.Advertisement“Clear individual accountability should focus minds, drive up standards, and make firms easier to run and to supervise,” she added. “And if things go wrong, it will allow senior managers to be held to account for misconduct that falls within their area of responsibility.”AdvertisementThe Financial Conduct Authority said in July that it was considering adding wholesale traders to its certification rules.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
