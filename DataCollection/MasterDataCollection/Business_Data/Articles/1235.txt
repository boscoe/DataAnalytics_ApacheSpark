WASHINGTON —  Factory activity in the world’s two biggest economies — the United States and China — slowed in January, a discouraging trend for the global economy.A separate report indicated a little more optimism on construction while another measure showed that consumers in the United States kept their spending flat in December.Manufacturing in the United States shrank in January for a fourth straight month as a strong dollar and weak demand overseas pinched American factories, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday.The I.S.M.’s manufacturing index ticked up to 48.2 from a revised 48 in December, but any reading below 50 signals a contraction. The index has remained below 50 since September.

Factory exports and employment fell in January, though new orders and production grew for the first time since October.AdvertisementIn China, an official survey found that manufacturing fell to its lowest level in more than three years. The index, based on a survey of Chinese factory purchasing managers, slipped to 49.4 from 49.7 in December. The January reading was the lowest since August 2012.AdvertisementProspects for the global economy have been dimmed by China’s sharp deceleration, which has, in turn, hurt emerging economies that have supplied China with materials.Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the I.S.M. survey committee, said manufacturing in the United States would most likely remain weak in coming months, slowed by the strong dollar and excess stockpiles of raw materials held by many companies. That means they will probably order fewer goods as they reduce those stockpiles.

“For now, it’s more of the same,” Mr. Holcomb said. “New orders are a bright spot here, and we’ll hope that continues.”A report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed that construction spending increased 0.1 percent in December after falling in October and November.The increase was driven by gains in home construction and spending on government projects. Those advances offset declines in spending on private construction of shopping centers, office buildings and hotels.For all of 2015, construction jumped 10.5 percent to $1.1 trillion, the highest total since 2007.Consumers, however, kept their spending flat in December and instead increased their savings rate to the highest level in three years. The spending figure was unchanged in December after rising 0.5 percent in November, while incomes increased 0.3 percent, according to a report on Monday from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department.Higher incomes and flat spending pushed the savings rate to 5.5 percent of after-tax income in December. That was the highest level since December 2012.A version of this list appears in print on February 2, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Slowdown for Factories in the U.S. and China.
