Bank of America, which has struggled to maintain consistent earnings growth, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected profit in the fourth quarter, but the bank’s results showed signs of strain from soured energy loans.The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said net income increased 9 percent, to $3.3 billion, or 28 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of 26 cents a share.Revenue in the quarter rose about 4 percent, to $19.8 billion, on par with what analysts expected.“We saw solid customer activity in loan growth, deposits and wealth management asset flows, and we returned more capital to our shareholders,” the bank’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said in a statement.It was the fourth consecutive quarter that Bank of America reported higher profit from the year earlier period.AdvertisementThe results were also helped by relatively strong investment banking results. Sales and trading revenue increased 11 percent in the quarter, bolstered by strong activity in the bank’s fixed income, currencies and commodities unit.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            The bank’s fourth-quarter results were muted somewhat by the impact of dropping oil prices.The bank said provisions for credit losses increased $264 million in the fourth quarter, related to higher charge-offs and increased reserves.AdvertisementLast week, Citigroup reported a large increase in reserves, while Wells Fargo said its losses had increased from the third quarter because of low oil prices.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Already, some companies are on the verge of bankruptcy and the collateral backing their loans is shedding value, raising the prospect of large losses in the banking system.For now, executives at the largest banks have said the losses are manageable and oil and gas exposure is not a big percentage of overall loans.Still, bank stocks have been getting hammered since the start of the year, when the stock market turned volatile amid the collapse in oil prices and concern about China’s slowing economy. Bank of America’s shares are down more than 14 percent since then, while the broader market has fallen more than 8 percent.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
