LONDON —  Bankers who engaged in financial misconduct in a previous job could be at risk of losing their bonuses under new rules proposed on Wednesday by British regulators.The new rules would require employment contracts to allow for the clawing back of bonus payments if a banker’s previous company determines that the employee engaged in misconduct or failed to follow risk-management rules.A banker’s new company would be able to apply for a waiver if it believed the determination of misconduct was “manifestly unfair or unreasonable,” the Prudential Regulation Authority said. The authority is an arm of the Bank of England, the central bank.The proposal continues efforts by financial regulators in Europe to hold bankers accountable for improper actions that could play a role in precipitating financial upheavals in the future.AdvertisementIt comes on the heels of rules Britain introduced last year that allow regulators and financial institutions to recoup bonuses from senior executives, risk managers and others at banks for a period of up to 10 years if misconduct is uncovered.Advertisement“Having the right incentives is a crucial part of an effective accountability regime,” Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said in a news release on Wednesday. “Remuneration policies which lead to risk-reward imbalances, short-termism and excessive risk-taking undermine confidence in the financial sector. Individuals should be held accountable for their actions and not be able to actively evade the consequences of their actions.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
