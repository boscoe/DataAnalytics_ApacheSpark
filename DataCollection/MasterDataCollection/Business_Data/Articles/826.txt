Adding fuel to an increasingly contentious deal, the Williams Companies on Wednesday said it was suing Energy Transfer Equity and its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, for breaching their merger agreement.It is a bizarre turn of events for the $38 billion deal between Williams and Energy Transfer, which was signed in September but has since been dragged into the gutter with the sharp decline in commodity prices. Energy Transfer, based in Dallas — which would be taking on billions in debt to finance the acquisition — has sought any way out of the agreement. However, the deal is so ironclad that only Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., can end it by paying a $1.5 billion breakup fee.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Shareholders still have to approve it.Energy Transfer, however, has changed its outlook. In an amended filing last month, the company drastically reduced its estimate for how much the merger would lift earnings, slashing it to $170 million from the original $2 billion projection. Energy Transfer said it was also consolidating offices in Dallas, meaning potentially thousands of job cuts for Williams employees. The initial agreement said Williams’s presence in Oklahoma would be maintained.AdvertisementWilliams’s legal dispute, however, focuses on a transaction Energy Transfer recently made that gives certain unit holders, notably Mr. Warren, preferential treatment at the expense of investors in the soon-to-be combined company. Energy Transfer is a so-called master limited partnership that provides distributions — similar to dividends — to its investors. However, in a cash squeeze, those distributions can be cut. A recent private offering that Energy Transfer disclosed in March would give the select group protection if the company needed to reduce those distributions.Williams decided to sue Energy Transfer in the Delaware Court of Chancery to unwind the private offering, according to a statement Wednesday. It is suing Mr. Warren in the district court in Dallas, accusing him of wrongfully interfering with the merger.Advertisement“Williams has commenced litigation to protect the interests of its stockholders,” the company said in the statement. “The litigation is intended to ensure that Williams’s stockholders will receive the consideration to which they are entitled under the merger agreement.”In a securities filing on Wednesday, Energy Transfer said it “believes that it has complied, and it intends to continue to comply, with its obligations under the merger agreement with Williams and intends to vigorously defend against the claims made by Williams.”
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            Jamie Welch, who was the chief financial officer at Energy Transfer until he was abruptly fired in February, is also suing Energy Transfer. Mr. Welch said in a separate lawsuit last month that Energy Transfer gave no “reasonable explanation” for his termination and that it was “motivated by an agenda unrelated to Mr. Welch’s performance.”Mr. Welch, a former investment banker, was hired to solidify Energy Transfer’s deal with Williams. However, as oil and natural gas prices plummeted, so did the company’s stock price, making the deal a difficult one to swallow under the $6 billion in cash that Energy Transfer is required to pay to Williams shareholders.The deal is expected to close before July. Energy Transfer shares gained 3.6 percent in early trading on Wednesday, while Williams shares declined slightly.A version of this article appears in print on April 7, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Williams Sues Energy Transfer Over Breach of Merger Deal.
