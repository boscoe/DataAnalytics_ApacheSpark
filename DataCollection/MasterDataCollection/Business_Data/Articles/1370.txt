The executive shake-up at Viacom continues.Doug Herzog, who oversaw MTV and Comedy Central, is leaving the company in January as part of a broader reorganization under Robert M. Bakish, Viacom’s new chief executive.Mr. Herzog most recently worked as president of its Music & Entertainment Group, which included MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike and Logo TV networks. Now, the heads of those networks will directly report to Mr. Bakish, the company said Wednesday.Viacom’s TV networks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid digital changes transforming the way people watch television and interact with media. In recent years, the networks also have had a hard time replacing a number of longtime executives and creative people who left, including three of Comedy Central’s biggest stars: Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.            In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, profits in Viacom’s TV group declined 16 percent to $3.5 billion, dragged down by declines in advertising and affiliate revenues.AdvertisementMr. Herzog, 57, first joined Viacom in 1984, working at MTV just three years after its start. Over the years, he left the company, then returned and began to climb its ranks. He is credited with helping to start many of the company’s best-known franchises, including “South Park,” “The Daily Show,” “The Video Music Awards” and “MTV News.”Advertisement“Doug gives a lot of credit below to luck, but let’s be honest — no one is that lucky,” Mr. Bakish said in a memo to employees. “Doug made his own luck by being extremely good.”In a rallying-the-troops memo to his staff, Mr. Herzog recalled some of the highlights of his career: finding the comedian Jon Stewart in an MTV conference room, losing Dave Chappelle in South Africa and discovering the “South Park” creators. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, on VHS.He also complimented Mr. Bakish for bringing “true leadership and vision to Viacom.”“As a new year dawns, enormous change and disruption dominate the media landscape and the world at large,” he said. “And if content is indeed king, and brands its queen, then you represent a powerful kingdom poised to return Viacom where, once more, it will be the envy of its peers.”A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Executive  at Viacom  Will Depart  in Overhaul.
