Redstone, has filed a lawsuit against his daughter, Shari Redstone, and a team of nurses that echoes claims made earlier this year by another of Mr. Redstone’s former girlfriends, Manuela Herzer.In a cross-complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday, Ms. Holland accuses Ms. Redstone of operating a network of spies in an attempt to oust her father’s lovers from his home last year so Ms. Redstone could take control of his $40 billion media empire.Ms. Holland, 45, dated Mr. Redstone for five years and accuses Ms. Redstone of hiring private investigators to spy on Ms. Holland and argues that she also solicited Mr. Redstone’s nurses to leak information about his health and the couple’s finances and sex lives.Ms. Holland asserts that Ms. Redstone violated her privacy and induced a breach of contract because Mr. Redstone had previously agreed to provide financial support to Ms. Holland and her daughter for the rest of their lives. Ms. Holland’s suit comes after Mr. Redstone sued her and Ms. Herzer in October over claims that included elder abuse. In his suit, Mr. Redstone seeks about $150 million, the sum that his lawyers said he was tricked into giving the women.Robert N. Klieger, a lawyer for Mr. Redstone, said in a statement: “Through her frivolous cross-complaint, Sydney Holland has adopted the same pathetic tactics as her cohort, Manuela Herzer. We expect the jury will see them for who they truly are.”Advertisement
