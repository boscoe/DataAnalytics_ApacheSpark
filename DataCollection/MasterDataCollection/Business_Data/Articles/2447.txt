Other data released on Friday showed that construction spending fell in February and consumer sentiment slipped in March.The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 51.8 last month from 49.5 in February. Any reading above 50 signals growth.The improvement suggests that American factories are adapting to the turmoil abroad, where a stronger dollar and weakening economies in China, Japan and elsewhere have hurt sales.The details of the survey-based report were somewhat uneven. New orders and production improved, but the measure of employment at manufacturers contracted in a sign that factories are letting workers go.The setback in employment meshed with the government jobs report released separately on Friday, which showed that manufacturers shed 29,000 workers in March and 18,000 in February. The job market is otherwise healthy, anchored by improving demand for homes, health care and meals at restaurants.The stronger dollar has made American products more expensive in foreign markets, and falling demand from overseas customers has hurt manufacturing companies. The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, surveys about 200 American companies each month.In another report, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.5 percent in February, after a 2.1 percent gain in January. Weakness in nonresidential construction and government offset the strongest month for home construction in more than eight years.And the University of Michigan said consumer sentiment among Americans fell last month to its lowest level since October on worries about the country’s economic outlook. The university’s index of consumer sentiment dipped to 91 in March, from 91.7 in February.Rising gasoline prices have taken a toll on spirits. AAA said Friday that the average gallon of American gasoline cost $2.06, 17 percent more than a month ago.Advertisement
