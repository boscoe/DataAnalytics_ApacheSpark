The United States “absolutely must complete” work on ending the too-big-to-fail bank problem that helped plunge the global economy into recession eight years ago, an influential Federal Reserve policy maker said on Saturday.In remarks that appeared to respond to President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has promised to roll back Wall Street regulations, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, said there had been much progress in making the financial system “less prone to panics.”“Still,” he said in prepared remarks, “there is more to do before we can say that we have ended ‘too big to fail.’ This is work that we absolutely must complete.”Mr. Dudley’s comments, to a Group of 30 meeting of top world regulators, came a day after another powerful regulator at the United States central bank, Daniel K. Tarullo, issued a similar  warning. Mr. Tarullo said that this was “a good moment to remember just how bad things can be when financial stability is not effectively safeguarded and a financial crisis ensues.” He added, “It is, accordingly, also a good moment to caution against backsliding on the considerable progress that has been made toward a regulatory system that will provide just such a safeguard.”Mr. Dudley, whose institution acts as the Fed’s eyes and ears on Wall Street, said challenges remain in regulators’ safe and smooth handling of the hypothetical failure of a big bank with operations in multiple jurisdictions. “Bank leaders still have much to do to rebuild the trustworthiness of their industry,” he said.Mr. Trump has said that his administration will roll back elements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.A version of this article appears in print on December 4, 2016, on Page A29 of the New York edition with the headline: Fed Policy Maker Urges an End to ‘Too Big to Fail’.
