WASHINGTON — Private companies in the United States added workers at a brisk clip in December, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite signs that growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.While other data on Wednesday showed a slight moderation last month in services sector activity, details of the survey were fairly upbeat and suggested a pickup in the coming months.The economy is battling the impact of a buoyant dollar, inventory glut and relentless spending cuts by energy firms, which have been hurt by lower oil prices. These headwinds have hobbled manufacturing and strained exports."Today's data may not have been uniformly strong, but investors have little cause to be concerned about the U.S. economy," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.AdvertisementThe payrolls processor ADP said private sector employment rose by 257,000 last month, the largest gain since December 2014, after increasing by 211,000 in November.
            The deficit is the excess of imports over exports for goods and services. Amounts are rounded, in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.

Although the ADP data tends to overstate job gains in December because of a year-end accounting quirk, economists said there were no signs the labor market was slowing.AdvertisementThe ADP report, which was jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive December employment report, which will come out on Friday.In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 55.3 percent in December, from a reading of 55.9 percent in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.There were indications of strength in the report's details, and the institute said comments from the majority of industries “remain positive about business conditions and the overall economy.″Industries reported an increase in new and export orders, as well as a rise in employment. However, inventory growth continued to slow and many industries still considered stocks to be high.

Eleven nonmanufacturing industries, including retail trade, finance and insurance, and professional services reported growth last month. The five industries reporting contraction in activity included wholesale trade and transportation and warehousing.In a third report, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed in November as imports of goods fell to their lowest level in nearly five years, hinting at softening domestic demand amid an effort by businesses to trim bloated inventories.AdvertisementThe trade gap fell 5 percent, to $42.4 billion, in November.Despite the shrinking trade deficit, declining exports were the latest suggestion that economic growth braked sharply in the fourth quarter. The drop in imports could also be pointing to cooling domestic demand, which was flagged by weak automobile sales in December.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the weakest since May 2009. Capital and consumer goods imports also fell. Lower oil prices as well as increased domestic energy production also helped to curb the import bill.Another report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for factory goods fell in November and inventories declined for a fifth straight month.A version of this list appears in print on January 7, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Private Hiring Was Strong in December, ADP Says.
