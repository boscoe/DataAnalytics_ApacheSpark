Putting the two together could create an agricultural one-stop shop, one with annual sales of $67 billion.Monsanto rejected Bayer’s initial bid and reportedly has held discussions with another big chemical maker, BASF.“We are convinced that this transaction is the best opportunity available to provide Monsanto shareholders with highly attractive, immediate and certain value,” Werner Baumann, Bayer’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Bayer is fully committed to pursuing this transaction.”Bayer added that its offer was not subject to financing, with loans that would be provided by five major banks.The German company also proposed a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a merger of the two companies ran afoul of government regulators — a concession to concerns that a transaction could raise opposition from antitrust officials.Though the two companies operate on separate sides of the agricultural business, regulators may closely scrutinize a merger that could put additional pricing pressure on farmers.In its own statement, Monsanto said that it was reviewing the new offer.Shares of Monsanto were up 2.3 percent in midday trading on Thursday, though at $103.55 they were still well below the offer, suggesting investor skepticism over the prospects of an agreement.Advertisement
