The European Union relies on the Russian energy giant Gazprom for about a third of its supplies. Moscow, in turn, earns significant revenue from selling gas to Europe.The commission’s priority is to prevent a repeat of the so-called gas wars of 2006 and 2009. Back then, Gazprom stopped shipping fuel through Ukraine, choking off supplies westward and leaving citizens in member states like Bulgaria shivering in the midwinter cold.“We are still far too vulnerable” to a major disruption of gas supplies, Miguel Arias Cañete, the European commissioner for climate action and energy, told a news conference on Tuesday.“With political tensions on our borders still on a knife edge, this is a sharp reminder that this problem is not just going to go away,” said Mr. Arias Cañete, apparently referring to continuing tensions with Russia over its annexation of Crimea two years ago and its efforts at destabilizing Ukraine.The latest proposals — which must still be approved by the various countries and the European Parliament before becoming law — are aimed at doing more to prevent shortages, making pricing more transparent and stopping suppliers like Gazprom from favoring individual countries with preferential deals.The main measure announced on Tuesday would force member states to give the commission advance notice of gas-supply deals with foreign suppliers. In doing so, they would have to provide information like the maximum daily volumes of gas to be shipped and the conditions under which these deliveries could be suspended.If the commission finds the contracts unfavorable, it can make recommendations that countries must carefully consider or risk being taken to court.The commission also wants to look at gas contracts signed between companies — but only when such an arrangement gives any non-European Union supplier more than a 40 percent share of the market within a single country.Another measure would strengthen existing obligations on countries to share gas so it moves more freely and a single supplier can exert less control.It would also oblige countries to supply their neighbors’ households and essential social services, such as hospitals and schools, before supplying their domestic industries during serious emergencies.The commission has already pushed countries to share gas with their neighbors, and a year ago it began an initiative to better coordinate energy policy.“By all means, this is positive,” said Linas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, a Baltic state formerly part of the Soviet Union. “Energy was always used as a tool by Russia” for “blackmailing” and “leverage,” he said.It is not yet clear if the new measures will stop member states from working on projects where national interests conflict.Germany, for example, favors expanding an existing Russian-backed pipeline called Nord Stream that bypasses Ukraine, but such plans have been opposed by Italy and Poland.The commission was still “assessing the legal position” regarding the expansion of Nord Stream, said Mr. Arias Cañete, who noted that the project had become “highly political.”Advertisement
