WASHINGTON — Consumer prices in April had their biggest increase in more than three years in the United States as gasoline and rents rose, pointing to a steady inflation buildup.Other data on Tuesday showed that housing starts and industrial production rebounded strongly last month, suggesting the economy was regaining steam early in the second quarter.“The combination of higher prices, housing gains and industrial production support the narrative of a second-quarter rebound in G.D.P.,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since February 2013, after rising 0.1 percent in March. That took the year-on-year increase in the C.P.I. to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in March.
