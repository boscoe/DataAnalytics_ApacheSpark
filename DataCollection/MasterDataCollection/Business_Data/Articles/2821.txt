CBS announced on Monday that Stephen Colbert had added Megyn Kelly to his list of guests for a special edition of his show that will air in the valuable post-Super Bowl slot on Sunday night.Ms. Kelly has been at the center of a political storm in the last week, after Donald J. Trump said that it was her questioning — which he called unfair — that prompted him to drop out of last week’s Republican presidential debate on Fox News.She has addressed the controversy, with some restraint, on her prime time show on Fox News, the second-most-viewed cable news show behind “The O’Reilly Factor,” hosted by Bill O’Reilly and also on Fox News.Ms. Kelly will join a lineup of guests that include Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Will Ferrell and the comedy team Key and Peele.Advertisement(And the Fox News host is making the rounds: She will also appear on “The Tonight Show” on Thursday.)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
