The Coca-Cola Company managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations, reporting strong profits for its fourth quarter thanks to higher prices for its products.The company also said on Tuesday that it would accelerate sales of its bottling operations, a tactic favored by investment analysts because it bolsters earnings.Volume sales for the last quarter of 2015 continued to shift toward noncarbonated drinks like bottled water, tea and juice, which grew at three times the rate of sales for carbonated drinks.Revenue in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 fell to $10 billion, down 8 percent, compared with $10.9 billion in the same period a year earlier. The figures, though, exceeded analysts’ expectations.AdvertisementProfit rose to $1.24 billion, or 28 cents a share, up from $770 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, Coke’s earnings were 38 cents a share, a penny more than analysts had predicted.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Profit for the year rose to $7.4 billion, a 3 percent gain over $7.1 billion in 2014.A version of this article appears in print on February 10, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: A Solid Profit for Coke Tops Wall Street Forecasts.
