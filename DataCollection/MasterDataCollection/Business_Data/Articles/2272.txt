That was the case in 2010 and 2011, but it would not guarantee more range in the films nominated. Only “The Blind Side,” which featured a young black actor, Quinton Aaron, and “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” could make a serious claim to ethnic diversity among the best picture nominees in those years.A less likely adjustment — but one that has been floated internally by some at the academy in recent days — might also open the acting categories to a larger group of nominees, say, eight or even 10.Expanding the acting nominations could result in more black, Hispanic or Asian contenders, though it would certainly rile those who regard the five-nominee system, in place since the 1930s, as sacrosanct.Also possible is a requirement that academy members cast a ballot regularly, or lose voting privileges temporarily. It was not immediately clear how a use-it-or-lose-it provision would change the voting.No firm plan to change voting methods, or possibly the membership process, is likely before a meeting of the academy’s 51-member governing board on Tuesday, according to the people briefed on the matter.But officers and executives of the academy have been scrambling to find changes that might broaden the nominees next year, even as they wait for a push for diversity to substantially change a voting base that in the past was heavily white, older and male. The academy’s membership is made up of more than 6,000 movie professionals from around the world. Invitations to join are extended annually based on achievement and other contributions to the industry.In a statement on Monday the group’s president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, pointed toward “dramatic steps” and an immediate review of how members are recruited.An academy spokeswoman declined to discuss the expected steps.But a larger best picture field might have opened the door this year to “Straight Outta Compton” or “Creed.” The current nominating system, in which voters are asked to list five films in order of preference and then the field is winnowed to a group that can vary from five to 10 movies, based on intensity of support, may also have played a role.Some academy insiders have long urged that Dawn Hudson, the group’s chief executive, and Ms. Isaacs, its elected president — both of whom have been pressing for more diversity — consider stronger measures to bar from voting those members who have not been active in the film industry for a certain period, say 10 or 20 years.But such a move would inevitably meet fierce resistance, and does not appear likely at Tuesday’s meeting, which is a regularly scheduled session. Some academy members privately suggested this week that any move to ditch the older members’ votes might provoke a class-action lawsuit.An unsettling possibility remains, notwithstanding any changes: Next year the academy may have to choose from an even slimmer field of ethnically diverse contenders, as some of the most prominent black stars and filmmakers turn toward less-obvious awards bets, or television.For instance, Ryan Coogler, who directed “Creed” — and was not nominated — has been lined up as the director of Marvel’s “Black Panther,” and Ava DuVernay, who directed “Selma,” a nominee for best picture but not best director last year, is working on a television series, “Queen Sugar.”Whatever emerges from Tuesday’s meeting, the academy’s staff, governors and officers alike have been aware of a need for immediate action, if they are to head off damage to a show set for broadcast on Feb. 28 by ABC.Though there have been calls for a boycott, and Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett-Smith have both said they intend to avoid the show, Chris Rock has so far remained committed to hosting the ceremony.While the boycott movement remains short of a showstopper, academy associates have been working feverishly to defuse the controversy, and perhaps to include some of those who were not nominated — one person being courted to appear is Ms. Pinkett Smith’s husband, Will Smith, overlooked for his role in “Concussion.”Whether Mr. Smith will appear, on stage or off, on Oscar night is unclear. But race will certainly be front-and-center among the topics that Mr. Rock, a comedian who does not shy away from much, cannot avoid.Advertisement
