D. Power and Associates for $1.1 billion from McGraw Hill Financial, in what will be its biggest investment yet and its first in the United States.J. D. Power, best known for its consumer surveys in more than a dozen industries, notably for new cars, has been a subsidiary of McGraw Hill Financial for 11 years.The survey firm employs over 800 people to sift through consumer insights for dozens of large corporate customers. XIO Group, which is based in London and aims to help companies expand into Asia, says it believes J. D. Power fits with its strategy.“We saw an opportunity for us to work together with the management to bring them to some untapped opportunities in some fast-growing regions around the world,” said Joseph Pacini, the chief executive of XIO Group.McGraw Hill Financial said in October that it had hired Morgan Stanley to review options for J.

Power would have annual revenue of about $350 million in 2016.“The transaction represents good value for our shareholders and positions J. D. Power for continued success,” said Douglas L. Peterson, the president and chief executive of McGraw Hill Financial. “Our portfolio will now be even more focused on financial intelligence businesses with a common set of attributes.”The deal is expected to close during the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals.Advertisement
