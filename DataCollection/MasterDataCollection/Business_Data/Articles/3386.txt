Stocks on Wall Street gave up early gains and ended slightly lower, extending a losing streak for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to a ninth day, the longest losing streak in 36 years. Investors continue to focus on the presidential election.KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed 0.2 percent lower. The Nasdaq composite index also lost 0.2 percent.PRESIDENTIAL RACE With five days left until the election, Hillary Clinton is still leading in national polling, but Donald J. Trump has significantly narrowed the gap, particularly in swing states. Investors like certainty, and Mrs. Clinton is viewed as likely to maintain the status quo. Mr. Trump’s policies are less clear, and the uncertainty has caused jitters in financial markets. The VIX, a measure of volatility that is called Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” jumped 16 percent this week to its highest level since June. The measure is up 36 percent this week alone.ANALYST’S TAKE “No one really knows what Trump would do should he get into power, probably not even himself,” said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG. “It is that uncertainty that is driving the market negativity that has dominated this week.”
