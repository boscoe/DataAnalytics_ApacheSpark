Starboard estimated the value of the assets at about $21 billion, or nearly double the company’s $11 billion market value as of Friday’s close.The letter comes after Macy’s reported slumping holiday sales, the latest blow to a retailer that has been suffering from competition by discounters like T.J. Maxx and fast fashion outlets like H&M.In its results, the company added that it has enlisted Eastdil Secured, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs to help it essentially sell minority stakes in its property. Among the interested suitors is Tishman Speyer, the big real estate firm.Macy’s has already dismissed calls to consider more drastic options for its real estate, including spinning it off into a real estate investment trust. (That strategy, long beloved by activist hedge funds, appears close to disappearing after the House of Representatives passed legislation ending the tax benefits of such a move.)The letter from Starboard says that Macy’s plans appear to mirror the hedge fund’s thinking, and that the potential joint ventures would yield significant amounts of cash that could be used to pay down debt and showcase the value of those holdings.“Despite what is clearly a challenging retail environment, we believe the execution of the real estate strategy outlined in the attached presentation can create meaningful and lasting value for shareholders,” Jeffrey C. Smith, Starboard’s managing member, wrote in the letter. “When matched with an operational turnaround plan that includes hundreds of millions in cost reductions and margin improvement, we believe Macy’s is an extremely attractive investment.”In a statement, Macy’s said that Starboard’s argument “is consistent with actions already underway” at the company.The cordial tone of Starboard’s letter contrasts with its bare-knuckled approach at Yahoo, where the hedge fund is weighing a potential board challenge to force Yahoo into weighing a sale of its mainstay Internet businesses.Advertisement
