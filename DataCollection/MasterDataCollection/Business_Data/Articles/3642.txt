SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Brookfield Asset Management of Canada continued its push into Latin America on Wednesday with a $2 billion purchase of the Colombian government’s 57.6 percent stake in that country’s third-largest electricity producer, Isagen.The deal requires Brookfield and its institutional partners to make an offer in March for the rest of the company’s shares, currently in private hands. If all the other shareholders choose to sell, the investment could rise to $3.4 billion.Colombia’s government announced the privatization of Isagen in 2013 to raise funds to invest in highways. At the time, the finance minister, Mauricio Cárdenas, said the government expected about $2.4 billion from the sale.By 2014, the government was hoping to raise closer to $3 billion after receiving preliminary proposals from seven companies, including Duke Energy in the United States, Huadian of China and Engie of France, formerly GDF Suez.AdvertisementBut the government decided to postpone the sale to give potential buyers more time to study the company. Then, in May 2015, a court blocked the privatization.AdvertisementLegal challenges were overcome last September, but the Colombian peso had fallen sharply along with prices for the country’s commodity exports, and one bidder after another had dropped out of the running.After Colbun of Chile withdrew from the auction on Monday, Brookfield was left as the only bidder. The sale took place at the minimum price: 6.486 trillion Colombian pesos, or $2 billion.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Its chief executive, Bruce Flatt, reaffirmed the firm’s interest in emerging markets in November, saying that he saw “value opportunities which are not available in scale in many other places in the world today” and that Brazil and China were merely suffering “growing pains in otherwise solid markets.”Over the last 18 months, Brookfield spent about $900 million to buy a 26.5 percent stake in the logistics company VLI from the mining giant Vale, $600 million to buy real estate from BR Properties of Brazil and $120 million to buy hydroelectric plants in Brazil.Brookfield is also negotiating to buy a stake in the Brazilian logistics company Invepar for about $350 million and to take private a Brazilian toll road company, Arteris.Credit Suisse advised the Colombian government on the auction.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
