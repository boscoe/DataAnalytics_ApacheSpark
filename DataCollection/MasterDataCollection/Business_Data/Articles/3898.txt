The chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase says that interest rates should rise "as long as the American economy is chugging along."JPMorgan Chase paid Jamie Dimon, its chairman and chief executive, 35 percent more in 2015 than the previous year’s compensation package, which was only narrowly approved by shareholders.According to a securities filing on Thursday, Mr. Dimon received $27 million — much of it in stock linked to the bank’s performance, one week after the bank recorded a record profit of $24.4 billion for the year.Pay disclosures by Wall Street firms are closely watched, as many banks face pressure from shareholders to overhaul pay practices. That has caused many banks to shift more pay to stock that will be granted only if the company meets certain performance goals.JPMorgan is the first big bank to disclose 2015 compensation for its top executives. The annual disclosure about Mr. Dimon, who runs the biggest bank in the United States in terms of assets, often sets the bar for the industry.AdvertisementStill, overall compensation on Wall Street is down as firms grapple with volatile markets. At Goldman Sachs, where revenue slipped 2 percent last year, the amount of money set aside for employee pay was about the same as the previous year. At Morgan Stanley, compensation in the investment bank as well as the wealth management division declined.AdvertisementThis is the first year JPMorgan is using performance share units as part of the variable pay for its top executives. The units are tied to whether the bank meets certain financial performance goals over the next couple of years.Mr. Dimon’s salary was $1.5 million last year, the same as the previous year. His cash bonus dropped to $5 million from $7.5 million, but his stock award jumped to $20.5 million from $11.1 million.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            For 2014, Mr. Dimon got restricted stock units. He did not get a pay increase from 2013 to 2014, receiving $20 million both years.JPMorgan shareholders nearly voted down 2014 pay for the bank’s top executives at last spring’s annual meeting, prompting the move to performance-based awards.Only 61 percent of votes cast were in favor of the bank’s executive compensation after it came under heavy criticism from the influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Company, which said the board’s policies did not adequately link pay to performance.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For 2015, that percentage dropped to 20 percent.Last year, JPMorgan’s stock rose 5.7 percent, significantly outperforming its major rivals, almost all of which ended the year in the red. Banks with large Wall Street divisions, like JPMorgan, have faced a number of challenges lately, including new regulations and volatile markets. Analysts and investors have given Mr. Dimon credit for steering his firm past these rough spots.  Other top JPMorgan executives received half their stock-based bonuses in the form of performance stock units, the bank said on Thursday. Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer, received $3.075 million in restricted stock and another $3.075 million in performance share units. Mary Callahan Erdoes, the chief executive of its asset management division, received $5.175 million in restricted stock and $5.175 million in performance share units.AdvertisementDaniel E. Pinto, the chief executive of corporate and investment banking, received $5,807,875 in restricted stock and the same in performance shares, and Matthew E. Zames, the chief operating officer, received $5.325 million each in restricted stock and performance shares.Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: JPMorgan’s C.E.O.
