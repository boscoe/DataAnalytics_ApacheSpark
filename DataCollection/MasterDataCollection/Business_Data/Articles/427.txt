The expectation that prices will remain low is forcing them to take major write-downs on the value of their assets, with big impacts on their earnings.Eni is no exception, and the company said on Friday that it now expected that crude oil prices would “continue to be weak due to structural imbalances in the marketplace.”The company revised its view of prices for 2016-19 to $65 a barrel, from its previous forecast of $90 a barrel. That lower figure, however, is still substantially above the current price of about $35 a barrel for Brent crude, an international benchmark.Because lower prices would translate into reduced cash flows, Eni said it had taken €4.7 billion in write-downs in the fourth quarter, with the largest impairments coming in countries including Algeria, Republic of Congo and Turkmenistan. The company also said it had taken write-downs in Angola, Britain, Norway and the United States.Like other energy companies, Eni is scrambling to bring costs in line with sharply lower revenues, saying it will cut capital spending by 20 percent in 2016, after a 17 percent reduction in 2015.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Claudio Descalzi, who became chief executive of Eni in 2014, has been trying to sharpen its focus on exploration and production and to reduce its focus on less profitable businesses.He has reduced Eni’s share in Saipem, a troubled oil services company, to about 30 percent by selling part of its stake to an investment arm of the Italian government. That deal brought Eni €4.8 billion in “net proceeds,” the company said. Mr. Descalzi is also trying to find a partner to run Versalis, Eni’s struggling chemicals unit.“We are continuing Eni’s transformation process” to be “better able to operate in difficult external conditions,” Mr. Descalzi said in a statement on Friday.In recent years, Eni has been a leader among major energy firms at finding oil and gas, though the company’s discoveries off Mozambique, Norway and Republic of Congo are worth less than when they were first found because of the fall in energy prices.The company’s finds last year included a major natural gas field off Egypt, and Eni said it had added a total of 1.4 billion barrels of oil and gas to its reserves, more than twice the volume that it produced during the year.Partly because of a knack for finding oil and gas in Africa, Eni’s exploration costs were just 70 cents for each barrel it discovered, and its overall production costs were about $21 per barrel. That figure was “hard to beat” outside of the best shale oil fields in the United States, Oswald Clint, a London-based analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in an email.These low costs probably explain why the company’s share price rose about 6 percent in trading on Friday despite the reported losses.Advertisement
