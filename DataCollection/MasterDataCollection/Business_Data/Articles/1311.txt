HONG KONG — Chinese stocks dropped steeply on Thursday, days after the ouster of the country’s top securities regulator and just ahead of Group of 20 meetings in Shanghai. The drop reversed some of the gains made since the Lunar New Year holiday this month.The Shanghai composite index plunged 6.4 percent after having edged up throughout February. The Shenzhen composite slid 7.3 percent. The ChiNext index of smaller companies also took a battering, closing 7.6 percent lower.
                China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.            The sharp sell-off comes at an awkward time, less than a week after China’s leadership, which has been battling to rally confidence in its ability to manage the economy, replaced Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.Mr. Xiao took a huge portion of the blame for amplifying the turbulence in China’s stock market, which kicked off last summer and reignited at the beginning of this year. Under his leadership, measures introduced to stem volatility and stabilize the markets ended up worsening a weeklong rout at the beginning of January that sent jitters around the world.Mr. Xiao was replaced by Liu Shiyu, the former chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China and a former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China. The high-profile move to force Mr. Xiao out appeared to be an attempt to buy time to limit the damage from the bungled management of the stock markets. But the sell-off on Thursday indicated that investors were still nervous.The rest of Asia was more mixed. The Nikkei 225-stock index in Japan closed 1.4 percent higher, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down 1.5 percent. Shares in South Korea and Australia inched up.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
