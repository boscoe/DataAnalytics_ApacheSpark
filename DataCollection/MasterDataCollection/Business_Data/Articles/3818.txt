The billionaire businessman Ronald O. Perelman plans to explore “strategic alternatives” for Revlon, the cosmetics company he has controlled through his investment firm for more than two decades.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, MacAndrews & Forbes, Mr. Perelman’s investment firm, said that it expected “from time to time to communicate with third parties” and Revlon about a potential transaction, but that it had “not formulated any specific or definitive plan.”“There can be no assurance that exploration of any transaction, to the extent undertaken, would result in interest by any third party, or result in a transaction,” MacAndrews & Forbes said in the filing.Mr. Perelman, through MacAndrews & Forbes, owns about 78 percent of Revlon’s outstanding shares.He first gained control of Revlon in 1985 through a hostile takeover and tried to take the company private in 2009.Revlon’s stock price has been hit hard in the last year, declining 24 percent. The company has a market value of about $1.3 billion.In its most recent financial disclosure, Revlon said that its profit declined to $6.2 million in the third quarter, from $14.6 million in the prior-year period.A version of this article appears in print on January 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; As Revlon’s Profit Falls, Perelman Hints at a Sale.
