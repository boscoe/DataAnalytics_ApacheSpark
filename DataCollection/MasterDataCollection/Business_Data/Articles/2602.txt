LONDON — Britain’s markets regulator said on Wednesday that investors should have more information available to them earlier in the initial public offering process. The call came as the regulator considers whether to revamp the system for public listings of stocks in Britain.As part of a study on investment and corporate banking, the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, found that during the initial part of the I.P.O. process, investors had access only to research from banks acting as underwriters.Because of a blackout period of up to two weeks imposed by the underwriters, investors often receive access to an initial prospectus only within two weeks of a company’s I.P.O., the authority found, and do not receive a final, approved prospectus until the first day of trading.By comparison, the United States only allows the prospectus, which is updated throughout the process, to be used to market an offering, the British regulator said.AdvertisementIn a discussion paper on Wednesday, the regulator suggested a series of possible overhauls that would flip the British process: the approved prospectus would be available earlier and would serve as the primary source of information available to investors before a public listing.AdvertisementThe regulator also suggested that research analysts not connected to the underwriters be given access to a company’s management as part of the process. Of 169 transactions examined by the agency, only one included research not connected with the underwriters being published during the I.P.O. process.“We want to start a discussion on changing the sequence of the I.P.O. process to make the market work better, by giving investors the right information at the right time,” Christopher Woolard, the Financial Conduct Authority’s director of strategy and competition, said in a news release.The proposed changes come as London is becoming an increasingly popular market for public listings.The Financial Conduct Authority said that it would seek public input on possible changes through July 13, and that it would issue a further consultation paper if it decides to pursue any specific policy changes.A vast majority of I.P.O.s in Britain are carried out through private placements to institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds, with a few offerings including the sale of a small percentage of shares to retail investors.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That included 199 I.P.O.s last year.During the typical I.P.O. process in Britain, connected research is published around the same time a company publicly announces its intention to pursue an offering, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Next comes a 10- to 14-day blackout period, followed by the circulation of the initial prospectus and price range to a select group of institutional investors, the regulator said.Company management teams conduct roadshows with investors, and a book of potential investors is then put together in the two weeks that precede the I.P.O., with the final, approved prospectus published on the first day of trading, the Financial Conduct Authority said.AdvertisementUnder a series of possible models cited by the Financial Conduct Authority on Wednesday, an approved prospectus containing no price information — similar to what is done in the United States — would be circulated first.That would most likely be followed by a blackout period of up to seven days after the initial prospectus is circulated, before connected research could be distributed, the regulator said.The Financial Conduct Authority also suggested the possibility of giving unconnected analysts access to management, perhaps at the same time that analysts connected with the underwriters meet with the company early in the process.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
