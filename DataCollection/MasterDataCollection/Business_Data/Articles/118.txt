Thursdayâ€™s announcement that AMC Entertainment will acquire Carmike Cinemas is the latest move in a consolidation of the movie theater business that has been underway for at least 20 years. In 1995, Carmike, based in Georgia, was the largest chain in the United States, with about 2,500 screens. AMC, then known as American Multi-Cinema and based in Missouri (now in Kansas), was in third place, with almost 2,000 screens. But a wave of theater sales and bankruptcies, along with later multiplex expansion during a rebound, changed the configuration. AMC Entertainment, which was purchased at the beginning of the year by the Dalian Wanda Group of China, is poised to control one out of five theaters in the United States.Top Five CHAINS*:AMC Entertainment8,380 screensRegal Entertainment7,334 screensCinemark4,518 screensMarcus Theaters664 screensHarkins Theaters448 screensTOP FIVE CHAINS:Regal Entertainment7,295 screensAMC Entertainment4,960 screensCinemark4,457 screensCarmike Cinemas2,892 screensMarcus Theaters681 screensTOP FIVE CHAINS: Regal Entertainment6,373 screens AMC Entertainment4,475 screens Cinemark3,508 screens Carmike Cinemas2,469 screens National Amusements1,052 screens TOP FIVE CHAINS: Carmike Cinemas2,469 screens United Artists2,380 screens American Multi-Cinema1,950 screens Cinemark1,444 screens Regal Cinemas1,282 * Estimated counts.
