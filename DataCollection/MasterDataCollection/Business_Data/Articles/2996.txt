One young man in a University of California, Santa Barbara, jacket took a selfie with his middle finger hanging over Mr. Trump’s star — an apparently popular pose — while a little girl, on her mother’s advice, scuffed it with her shoes. But a group of seven young tourists had themselves photographed in a smiling cluster around Hollywood’s minimonument to Trump, so things looked about even.Since various news organizations reported that Mr. Trump’s star had been repeatedly vandalized with purple paint, hostile graffiti and other marks of contempt, the marker has become almost as popular with the media as with the visiting crowds. On Thursday, a reporter and a camera operator from Sky News in Britain were recording reactions, pro and con.As usual, Mr. Trump occupies prime real estate. His star is in the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard, just east of a grand staircase leading into the Hollywood & Highland Center. In other words, he’s right where the red carpet runs past those bleachers full of cheering fans on Academy Awards night.He’s certainly in good company, right next to Kevin Spacey and just west of Jerry Lewis. But on Thursday, those two were getting less attention than the phony plastic Oscars and the Scientology tracts stacked in nearby storefronts.The Trump star had obviously been cleaned up since it was photographed earlier with scrawls that read “racist” and “Trump is a chump.” In fact, the only obvious damage, notwithstanding that little girl’s scuffle, was a Band-Aid-size patch of goo.Polling-wise, a larger sample of the tourist yeas and neas was probably in order. But some big raindrops started falling. Plus, a dozen or so religious demonstrators were converging on the site with loudspeakers and “Repent” signs.“It’s never boring, is it?” said that Sky News reporter.Advertisement
