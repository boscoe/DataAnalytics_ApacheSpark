Toyota Motors has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class-action lawsuit brought by American owners of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs’ lawyers said in court papers.The proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickup trucks, Tundra full-size pickup trucks and Sequoia S.U.V.s suspected of receiving inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to the court papers.In court papers supporting the settlement, lawyers for the plaintiffs estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle. They estimated the cost of inspections at about $90 million, or $60 per vehicle.Toyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed last Wednesday before Judge Fernando M. Olguin of Federal District Court in Los Angeles.Advertisement“We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It will also reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement.The settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.AdvertisementToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in lawyers’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.A version of this article appears in print on November 14, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: $3.4 Billion Settlement in Toyota Rust Case.
