In an election season in which audiences for primary debates have shattered cable news records, the coverage of the Iowa caucus also achieved big numbers.On Monday night, the three main cable news networks drew their largest audiences ever for coverage of the Iowa caucus.Fox News had 4.5 million viewers in prime time Monday night, with CNN bringing in 3.7 million viewers and MSNBC drawing two million. All three totals represent enormous gains on previous election coverage of Iowa: CNN had 2.4 million more viewers than it did for its 2012 coverage in prime time, Fox had 1.8 million more and MSNBC had about 800,000 more viewers.
                Ted Cruz defied weeks of polling to beat Donald Trump in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.            Fox News’s viewership peaked on Monday night from 10:45 p.m. to 11 p.m., with 5.1 million viewers.Perhaps most important to CNN, it won in the all-important 25-to-54 year old demographic in both prime time and in seven hours of total coverage, beginning at 7 p.m. CNN had 1.4 million viewers in the demographic in prime time — compared with Fox’s 1.2 million and MSNBC’s 592,000. CNN said that was the highest rating in that age bracket in Iowa caucus night in cable history.AdvertisementIn earlier coverage, Fox News and CNN both broadcast debates that set records for the networks and were among the highest-rated events in cable television history. Donald J. Trump’s candidacy has been largely credited with creating such outsize interest in coverage of the 2016 campaign.On Monday night, Mr. Trump finished in second place in the Republican caucus, behind Ted Cruz. Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side.AdvertisementViewership for caucus coverage on Monday, however, did fall a bit short of what the debates had attracted. The three cable networks attracted a total audience of about 10 million viewers in prime time. That was less than every Republican primary debate, including the one most recently on Fox News, which had 12.5 million viewers.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
