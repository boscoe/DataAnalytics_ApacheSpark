CreditBill Robles        Bernard L. Madoff is handcuffed as he turns away from the victims of his Ponzi scheme, who applaud his arrest. Charles Manson lunges toward a judge with a pencil in his hand, agitated at being denied the chance to cross-examine a detective. Larry Flynt of Hustler magazine sits in a gold-plated wheelchair looking on from a distance as the Supreme Court debates the boundaries of the First Amendment.These illustrations are part of 96 courtroom drawings that the Library of Congress has acquired as part of the Thomas V. Girardi collection, named after the prominent Los Angeles lawyer best known for leading a personal injury lawsuit made famous by the film about the consumer activist Erin Brockovich.The three illustrators featured in the collection — Aggie Kenny, Bill Robles and Elizabeth Williams — have chronicled famous trials over the last half-century, including the Wall Street trials of the “junk-bond king” Michael R. Milken, the entrepreneur Martha Stewart and Ivan F. Boesky, convicted of masterminding what was then the biggest insider-trading scandal in the 1980s. The newly acquired collection also includes politically sensitive trials, including those of the Iran-contra defendants; the French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn; the World Trade Center bomber, Mohammed A. Salameh; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, son-in-law of Osama bin Laden.“These courtroom illustrations play a role in documenting the United States,” said Sara W. Duke, curator of popular and applied graphic art in the prints and photographs division of the Library of Congress. “They are important not just for the celebrities that are covered, but for the law behind it and how people are represented.”AdvertisementOften the only recorded images of a trial, courtroom illustrations play an important role in United States history. Federal courtrooms are one of the few places left where, until recently, cameras were not allowed. Some courts have experimented with allowing cameras, but most remain closed to photographers.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One such drawing by Marilyn Church, acquired earlier by the Library of Congress, is from the 1984 Manhattan murder trial of Eddie Coaxum. Mr. Coaxum learned of his AIDS diagnosis shortly before the trial and in the drawing, court officers are shown wearing surgical masks and gloves. During the jury selection for the trial, a city health commissioner, Dr. David J. Sencer, was brought in to tell a group of 125 potential jurors that they could not contract AIDS from Mr. Coaxum.AdvertisementThe prints and photographs division of the Library of Congress has 15 million works of art alone, including prints, cartoons and photographs like Dorothea Lange’s series on migrants in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, and daguerreotypes of Abraham Lincoln. Two years ago, the Library of Congress borrowed the Lincoln King John 1215 Magna Carta from Lincoln Cathedral in England.“The thing that is remarkable is that we need about four more walls for the stuff we are not hanging up,” said Mr. Girardi, who serves on the Library’s Madison Council, a private board.Thomas Jefferson helped to lay the groundwork for the current Library of Congress when he sold his personal library to Congress in 1815 to replace the collection that was destroyed when the British burned the Capitol.In recent years, its leadership has been in tumult as its 13th librarian, James H. Billington, came under pressure for mismanagement. The position is nominated by the president and is meant to be a lifelong post. Dr. Billington, however, resigned and stepped down from his post on Sept. 30. David S. Mao has served as acting librarian since then. This week, Carla D. Hayden was nominated by President Obama to be the next librarian.The Thomas V. Girardi collection will be on exhibit along with other images from the prints and photographs division later this year or early next year in the library’s Thomas Jefferson Building.A picture caption on Friday with an article about a portfolio of courtroom drawings acquired by the Library of Congress described incorrectly the illustration of Bernard Madoff, the former investment manager who spearheaded a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. It shows him leaving a courtroom, but was not drawn at his trial. Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty and was not tried.A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Library of Congress Adds 96 Courtroom Drawings Illustrating Life and Law  .
