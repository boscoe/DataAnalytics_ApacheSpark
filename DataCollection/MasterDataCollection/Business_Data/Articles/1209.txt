Furthermore, the plummet occurred even as per capita attendance by teenagers and adults 25 to 39 increased.The clear message: Date night moviegoing is in a slump.Buried even deeper in the report are charts showing the gender and racial breakdown of the domestic audience for the biggest releases in their first two weeks. Only one of those top five films, “Inside Out,” from Pixar, had a predominantly female audience; women and girls accounted for 54 percent of its initial audience.The other four — “Furious 7,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “Jurassic World” — had a mostly male audience.“Age of Ultron” and “The Force Awakens,” which had a female lead character, were the most male-oriented of the bunch.Men and boys accounted for 58 percent of the whole.“The Force Awakens,” despite its multiethnic cast, had an audience that was 61 percent white, making it the least diverse of the top films. That contrasted sharply with “Furious 7,” which also had a diverse cast: Only 40 percent of its viewers were white, while 25 percent were Hispanic and 22 percent African-American.Over all, whites accounted for 55 percent of domestic ticket sales, Hispanics for 23 percent, African-Americans for 11 percent, and Asians and other ethnicities combined for another 11 percent. The total number of tickets sold in domestic markets was 1.32 billion, the report said.Advertisement
