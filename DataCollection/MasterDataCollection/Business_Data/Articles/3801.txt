Regulators have fined J.P. Morgan Securities $4 million for making false statements on the client website of its private bank and in its marketing materials about how its private bank advisers are paid.The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the fine on Wednesday; J.P. Morgan neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.Clients of J.P. Morgan’s private bank  must have $5 million or more in assets. Private banking clients are given extra personal service and specialized advice.The S.E.C. said that from 2009 to 2011, the bank falsely stated on its private banking website that its advisers were paid based on the performance of clients’ portfolios, not on commission. The claim was repeated in some marketing materials, such as a pitch book and a letter.Instead, the S.E.C. says, J.P. Morgan advisers are paid a salary and bonus not based on performance. The bank “misled customers into believing their brokers had skin in the game,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, said.A J.P. Morgan spokesman said, “There was no allegation that the mistake made years ago was intentional or that any client was harmed,” and added that the problems had been fixed.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
