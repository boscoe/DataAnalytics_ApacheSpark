LOS ANGELES — The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences survived, just barely, Sunday’s tumultuous Oscar telecast. Overall ratings tumbled to near record lows but did not completely implode, as some movie executives had feared.Even so, the hardest part is still to come: keeping all those diversity promises.Ratings for the grande dame of Hollywood award shows, broadcast on ABC, declined by roughly 8 percent from last year’s telecast — which itself was considered a ratings failure — as 34.3 million viewers watched host Chris Rock deride the academy for its lack of diversity and “Spotlight” win the best picture trophy. It was the lowest-rated Oscars in eight years, according to early Nielsen data, and the third-lowest since Nielsen began tracking viewership in the mid-1970s.Among the likely reasons for the decline: Black viewers, upset about a second straight year of all-white acting nominees, may have tuned their TVs elsewhere; Mr. Rock has lately been relatively absent from big and small screens; many of the nominated films were not widely seen by mainstream audiences; and soapbox moments to espouse causes — and there were plenty on Sunday — have historically turned off viewers.“The white Oscars tune-out this year was a smashing success,” two groups that had pushed for a viewer boycott, the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable and Project Islamic Hope, said in a joint statement on Monday. (Nielsen data for the number of black viewers watching the show was not immediately available.)
                The viewership for the Oscar telecast has generally fallen in recent years. The ratings have not come near the numbers in 1998, when “Titanic” won big.            Nielsen data reflecting quarter-hour segments of viewership indicates that Sunday’s show appeared to lose viewers as glamour (and movies) increasingly took a back seat to activism. The show started with ratings roughly on par with last year’s. But in 2015 the numbers then climbed and remained fairly stable, while Sunday’s ratings fluctuated and then fell more steadily in the show’s last hour, as issues of sexual assault, environmentalism and gay rights were put forward by presenters and award recipients.AdvertisementThe overarching theme of the night, of course, was a lack of black nominees, as Mr. Rock repeatedly lampooned the movie industry in an opening monologue and various sketches throughout the show. Sometimes the spoofing turned serious. “Is Hollywood racist? You’re damn right Hollywood’s racist,” Mr. Rock said, as stars and moguls squirmed at the Dolby Theater here.AdvertisementAcademy leaders decided to bluntly confront the diversity crisis in lockstep with Mr. Rock and the telecast’s producers, Reginald Hudlin and David Hill. Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy’s president, even took the unusual step of scolding the industry from the stage. “It’s not enough to just listen and agree,” she said of diversity efforts. “We must take action.” (ABC has little say in the show, something the network has, at times, tried to change and may revisit given the declining ratings.)Ms. Isaacs, Mr. Hudlin and Mr. Hill did not respond to interview requests on Monday.ABC noted that Sunday’s show held up better among viewers ages 18 to 49, a group that advertisers pay a premium to reach. Mr. Rock also attracted more male viewers of all ages than did Neil Patrick Harris, who hosted last year’s ceremony.The broader ratings declines for the Oscars continue a troubling trend for live award shows, which had been a rare bright spot for DVR-beleaguered networks. After several years of climbing ratings, the genre has been showing signs of viewer fatigue; the most recent Golden Globes, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, Emmy Awards and American Music Awards all showed declines by various ratings measures.Matters of diversity now threaten to overwhelm the institution just as they did Sunday’s show. The academy has only a few months to repair damaged processes, internal relationships and its public image before the next Oscar season descends in late summer, bringing with it a chilling prospect: What if voters, even after a planned purge of inactive members, again snub actors of color?Already, Fox Searchlight has stepped into the breach. That boutique studio, which backed recent best picture winners like “Birdman” and “12 Years a Slave,” in January acquired “The Birth of a Nation,” about the Nat Turner slave rebellion, for an eye-popping $17.5 million at the Sundance Film Festival. And it scheduled the film for October release, in the heart of the next Oscar season.The opportunity inherent in releasing an already critically acclaimed African-American film in the coming Oscar cycle cannot have been lost on Nancy Utley, the co-president of Fox Searchlight. Ms. Utley, who represents the public relations branch on the academy’s 51-member governing board, was in a position to play a significant role in the academy’s announcement on Jan. 22 of emergency diversity-related changes to its membership rules and governing processes.But many of those changes have yet to be put into effect — work that will only begin at an academy governors meeting set for March 15. Both that session and ensuing committee meetings must navigate sometimes fierce, if largely private, cross-currents and rivalries within a professional group that remains far from certain about its path.AdvertisementPerhaps the greatest uncertainties are rooted in an institutional tension between the academy’s professional staff, led by the chief executive, Dawn Hudson, and its elected officials, overseen by Ms. Isaacs. Relations between Ms. Hudson and Ms. Isaacs have occasionally been tense, according to people briefed on their dealings, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Ms. Hudson, 60, in her fifth year as chief executive, supervises hundreds of employees, and received $762,372 in current and deferred compensation for the year ended June 30, 2014, according to the latest academy tax return posted by the GuideStar reporting service. Ms. Isaacs, 66, has served for nearly three years, can be elected for a fourth under academy rules, and is not paid. Like recent presidents, she spends a considerable part of her workweek on the group’s affairs, in a position that has evolved into something close to a regular job. Ms. Hudson also did not respond to a request to be interviewed.Now, both must confront angry objections from older academy members who face the loss of voting privileges as part of the yet-to-be-executed new rules. Many older members have complained that they are being unfairly blamed for a recent wave of white nominations — even after they helped name “12 Years a Slave,” with a black director and stars, best picture in 2014.Senior academy officials privately acknowledged the extreme delicacy of removing voters who have now been tainted with an implied charge of racial bias.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Iñárritu, a winner on Sunday for his direction of “The Revenant,” told reporters backstage.“The debate is not only about black and white people,” he added. “We are yellow and Native Americans and Latin Americans.”A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Oscar Ratings Fell, but All Eyes Are on the Academy.
