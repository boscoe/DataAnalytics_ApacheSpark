WASHINGTON —  The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to resolve a dispute about what prosecutors need to prove to obtain insider trading convictions. The question has divided federal appeals courts, and the justices declined to address it in October.The new case comes from California and involves trading by Bassam Salman based on information from his future brother-in-law, then a member of Citigroup’s health care investment banking group. The question in the case, Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, is whether prosecutors had to prove that the brother-in-law, Maher Kara, disclosed the information in exchange for a personal benefit.Mr. Salman relied on a 2014 decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, United States v. Newman, that made it harder to prosecute insider trading cases. That was the decision the Supreme Court declined to review in October, dealing a setback to Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office oversaw a sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.In Mr. Salman’s case, the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, rejected the Second Circuit’s reasoning.AdvertisementBoth appeals courts interpreted a 1983 Supreme Court decision, Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, which required evidence that the insider “directly or indirectly” gained something from the initial disclosure.AdvertisementThe Second Circuit read the passage narrowly, saying it required “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.”
                The United States attorney in Manhattan oversaw a sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, but a federal appeals court upended the campaign.            The Ninth Circuit focused on a passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability “when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or a friend.”“In our case,” the Ninth Circuit said, “the government presented direct evidence that the disclosure was intended as a gift of market-sensitive information,” adding that the Second Circuit’s approach would have negative consequences.“If Salman’s theory were accepted and this evidence found to be insufficient,” the court said, “then a corporate insider or other person in possession of confidential and proprietary information would be free to disclose that information to her relatives, and they would be free to trade on it, provided only that she asked for no tangible compensation in return.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Rakoff, visiting from the Federal District Court in Manhattan. He had earlier expressed unease with the Second Circuit’s ruling in Newman, though as a trial judge he was bound to apply it. Acting as visiting appeals court judge gave him a chance to take on the Second Circuit more directly.As is its custom, the Supreme Court gave no reasons for agreeing to hear the case.The Justice Department unsuccessfully sought review of the Second Circuit’s ruling in the Newman case, arguing that it represented a significant change in decades of insider trading case law. Allowing the ruling to stand, the petition said, will “hurt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts and impair the government’s ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.”By contrast, the Justice Department urged the court to turn down Mr. Salman’s appeal of the Ninth Circuit’s decision. “Review is less warranted here than in Newman because the decision that petitioner urges this court to review is correct and wholly consistent with Dirks,” Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote. “The court of appeals thus faithfully applied this court’s precedent to reach a factually and legally correct result, and its decision should remain undisturbed.”The Supreme Court on Tuesday again declined to take the Justice Department’s advice.Follow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Supreme Court Will Hear a California Insider Trading Case.
