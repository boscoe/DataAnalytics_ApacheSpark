LONDON — WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company, said on Friday that strong growth in North America and a spate of major accounts helped it end 2015 with the best growth of the year and start 2016 on a solid footing.The agency, the last major ad group to report 2015 results, mirrored its peers in reporting a decent year-end result. The company enjoyed strong demand in North America, Britain and the big markets of Western Europe.“The pattern for 2016 looks very similar to 2015, but with the bonus of the maxi-quadrennial events of the visually stunning Rio Olympics, the UEFA Euro Football Championships and, of course, the United States presidential election,” said the company, which is based in Britain.WPP secured net new business of 5.6 billion pounds, or $7.9 billion, from companies such as Unilever, L’Oréal and Tesco, putting the firm at the top spot in the rankings for new work for the fourth year in a row.AdvertisementWPP, which handles the advertising needs of brands such as Ford through agencies including Ogilvy & Mather and JWT, reported fourth-quarter net sales growth of 4.9 percent, the strongest quarter of the year. That gave it a full-year figure of 3.3 percent, slightly ahead of forecasts.Led by the high-profile businessman Martin Sorrell, the company said it expected to produce a similar net sales growth rate for 2016 with an improvement in profitability and said it had already enjoyed an above-forecast month in January.AdvertisementAnalysts said the results were slightly ahead of expectations, but they noted that the language surrounding the outlook remained cautious. The firm listed  low oil prices, uncertainty surrounding global growth and the coming British referendum on European Union membership as areas of concern.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
