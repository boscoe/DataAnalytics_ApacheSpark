“I would have to consult my counsel, I’m not aware that that’s a conflict,” said Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, at a House panel.House lawmakers questioned Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, on Wednesday about the handling of the Wells Fargo accounts scandal, with some calling for tougher punishment of the biggest banks and their senior managers when they violate the law.Ms. Yellen appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to discuss the agency’s supervision of the banking system, including revelations that thousands of employees at Wells Fargo had opened as many as two million unauthorized bank and credit card accounts to meet high-pressure sales goals. Ms. Yellen faced a number of tough questions during the hearing about how regulators are responding to the issue, with some lawmakers asking whether banks had simply grown too big.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the City and County of Los Angeles fined the bank $185 million this month. Wells Fargo has fired more than 5,000 lower-level employees in the last few years and on Tuesday said it would take back tens of millions of dollars in compensation from top executives, but those moves have yet to quell the ire of some on Capitol Hill who would like to see more done.“Will you at least seriously consider breaking up Wells Fargo?” Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, asked Ms. Yellen at the hearing. Mr. Sherman, with the former presidential contender Senator Bernie Sanders, previously introduced legislation to dismantle the largest financial institutions.AdvertisementIn response, Ms. Yellen emphasized that regulators will hold financial institutions to “exceptionally high standards of risk management, internal controls, consumer protection.”Advertisement“We believe it is possible, even though it’s extremely challenging, for organizations to comply,” she added.Representative Michael E. Capuano, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked “How long does this stuff have to go on before you get outraged and take action?” He noted that the $185 million fine against Wells Fargo, which has $1.9 trillion in assets, “is barely a footnote in their annual report.”Ms. Yellen also fielded questions on a host of topics unrelated to Wells Fargo, including the agency’s efforts to reduce certain “stress test” requirements for midsize banks, plans to limit the holding of physical commodities by banks and oversight of bank “living wills” to wind down troubled institutions. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle asked Ms. Yellen to discuss the Fed’s monetary policy work and its decision last week to hold interest rates steady — at least for now.“We expect to see solid job growth continue, but we do need, if things continue on their current course, to gradually remove the accommodation that is there,” she said. Still, she said there was “no fixed timetable” on a rate increase.Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, argued that top officials at the Fed have become too “cozy” with Democrats and the White House. “I have certainly never been pressured in any way by the administration,” Ms. Yellen said later in her testimony. “My experience has been it greatly respects the Fed’s independence to make decisions in accord with our congressional mandate.”
                Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.            But many of the questions related to the Fed’s response to the events at Wells Fargo. Its chairman and chief executive, John G. Stumpf, is scheduled to appear before the panel on Thursday morning. Ms. Yellen testified that the Fed has oversight of bank holding companies and was not directly responsible for supervising the actions at issue in the Wells matter.Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, the ranking member on the committee, warned that the actions at the bank could raise concerns about risk to the financial system if not handled properly by regulators.Advertisement“Fraudulent retail banking practices may not in and of themselves pose systemic risk, but they surely indicate mismanagement that could be catastrophic in riskier and more complex divisions of a bank holding company,” she said. “Supervisors and law enforcement must continue to hold both institutions and individuals accountable.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The concerns play into longstanding frustrations, dating from to the financial crisis, that top managers are rarely required to take personal responsibility for the problems that afflict financial institutions.“I think there’s value in just getting after them,” said Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts. “I don’t care if you get a conviction or not. Just get after them and make their life hell.”Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, also pressed Ms. Yellen for insights on holding executives accountable.“How can line-level workers be held accountable to the degree that they clearly have been, and yet nobody in the upper level of management seems to be taking responsibility for it?” he asked. “They haven’t lost their jobs.”Ms. Yellen responded that “senior management has a responsibility, and it’s essential that they be held accountable.” She added that the banking agencies are working to complete a long-pending rule on executive compensation intended to limit excessive risk-taking at financial institutions.“I very much hope that we can finalize this rule,” Ms. Yellen said. “It has been a very long time, and I will do everything that I can at the Federal Reserve to be ready to act on this as soon as possible.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
