December sales were most likely buoyed by unseasonably mild weather and a rise in the supply of homes on the market, which increased choices for buyers."This is a promising sign for the housing market as we move into 2016,” said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance in Raleigh, N.C. “We expect the strong increase in new-home sales to continue as the fundamentals in the housing market remain strong and newer vintage homes are in short supply.”New-home sales soared 14.5 percent, to 501,000 units in 2015, the highest level since 2007. Housing is being supported by tightening labor market conditions, which are spurring a rise in household formation.A report last week showed a record increase in home resales in December from a 19-month low in November.A firmer housing sector should put a floor under the economy, which has been battered by the headwinds of a strong dollar, spending cuts by energy firms stung by lower oil prices and sluggish global demand. Efforts by businesses to whittle down an inventory bloat have also been a drag on growth.The stock market sell-off, which has brought a plunge in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index this month, is also adding to the pain.The government is scheduled to report on Friday that fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 0.8 percent annual rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists, slowing sharply from the third quarter’s 2 percent rate.In December, new-home sales jumped 20.8 percent in the Northeast and gained 0.4 percent in the populous South. They advanced 31.6 percent in the Midwest and shot up 21.0 percent in the West.The inventory of new homes on the market rose to 237,000 units last month, from 231,000 units in November. At December’s sales pace it would take 5.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in November.The median price of a new home fell 4.3 percent from a year ago to $288,900.Advertisement
