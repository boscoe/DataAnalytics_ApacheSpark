Hulk Hogan’s lawyer, Shane Vogt, said that editors of Gawker intended to harm his client when they posted an online excerpt of a secretly recorded video of him engaged in a sex act.ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Taking the stand as the first witness in his $100 million invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against the website Gawker, the former wrestling champion Hulk Hogan told a jury on Monday that he had been “completely humiliated” by the public release of a video that showed him having sex with his now-former best friend’s wife.The 62-year-old plaintiff — whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea — insisted he was unaware that a camera was recording the encounter, which he said had occurred only because his marriage was falling apart and his friend and his friend’s wife kept insisting that he have sex with her.“I was depressed,” Mr. Bollea, wearing his trademark black bandanna pulled low over his forehead, told the six-person jury in Pinellas County Circuit Court. “I gave up and gave in. I felt that those people loved me.”The trial, which is expected to last at least two or three weeks, is the latest prominent legal battle to highlight the murky line between the right to privacy and the right to free speech. Both sides have pointed to potential ramifications of the case: Mr. Bollea’s lawyers cautioned that the privacy of many Americans could be compromised, while Gawker cited the damage a guilty verdict would inflict on long-held freedoms of the press.AdvertisementIn opening arguments, Shane Vogt, a lawyer for the former wrestler, said that Gawker and its editors had deliberately shown his client “naked and exposed to the world” for six months on the site, generating millions of views, despite repeated requests by Mr. Bollea to take the video down. Mr. Vogt said that the situation had caused extreme “emotional distress and harm” to his client, a central point in Mr. Bollea’s pursuit of damages in the case.Advertisement“If they had taken down the video,” Mr. Vogt said, “we wouldn’t be here today.”The 30-minute video, apparently filmed in 2007 and later provided to Gawker, garnered five million page views when it was posted in an abridged version on the site in 2012 and 2.5 million views on other sites that posted it subsequently, Mr. Bollea’s lawyer said. In posting the video, he continued, Gawker allowed the public to watch Mr. Bollea having sex in a private bedroom without his knowledge or consent.Gawker’s founder, Nick Denton, and its former editor, A. J. Daulerio, who is also named in the suit, “knowingly and maliciously” published what Mr. Vogt called the pornographic images for the sole purpose of financial gain. The posts violated Florida law, he said — specifically a measure that prohibits the publication of private communications without permission — as well as basic human decency.“They’re going to try to tell you that what they were doing was news,” Mr. Vogt said, in an effort to dismiss a crucial element of the defense’s case: that the activities of well-known people are a subject of public concern. “They crossed the line when they posted this video. It was not newsworthy.”In his opening statement, a lawyer for the Gawker team, Michael Berry, told the jury that videotapes featuring celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian having sex have become a “cultural phenomenon,” and that such images are of interest to the public and therefore protected by the First Amendment.Mr. Bollea himself had encouraged and participated in efforts to disseminate facts and commentary about the most intimate details of his life, Mr. Berry said. Describing the former wrestler as “a real American hero” and, when he was younger, “the ultimate object of desire,” Mr. Berry said the plaintiff had been more than willing for years to talk about his sex life, including in two autobiographies, on a reality television series called “Hogan Knows Best” and on Howard Stern’s radio show.
                The Hulk Hogan sex tape case is one of several high-profile suits in which the line between news and privacy has been blurred.            This flow of information about his life was fine, Mr. Berry said, “until he didn’t like what Gawker had to say.’’Mr. Bollea, who will continue testifying on Tuesday, openly discussed the video at issue in an appearance on a television show run by the website TMZ and said he did not know who the woman with him was because he had been “running wild” with several women at the time, Mr. Berry said, quoting an earlier statement by Mr. Bollea.AdvertisementIn fact, she was Heather Clem, who was then married to Todd Clem, Mr. Bollea’s onetime friend and a radio “shock-jock” whose legal name is Bubba the Love Sponge. The former wrestler also sued the Clems after the tape became public, a case that was settled out of court.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

She also said that she played no part in disseminating the video and that she did not discuss with her husband who might have done so.In his testimony, Mr. Bollea said he had been stunned to learn that the man he considered his best friend, who acknowledged having an “open marriage,” might have used a camera installed in the bedroom to record the sexual encounter. Mr. Bollea said the entire experience was “surreal.”“Everything had gone to hell in a handbag,” Mr. Bollea said, describing a period in 2012 when the tape became public. “I still held out the hope that he had not done this to me.”When he learned that his friend’s voice could be heard at the end of the tape suggesting to his wife that they would be able to retire on the money they might make from selling the video, Mr. Bollea said, “my hands just started shaking.”“He made me believe that he was my best friend and that he would never lie to me,” said Mr. Bollea, who noted that he often had difficulty establishing close friendships.Under cross-examination, Mr. Bollea acknowledged that when he was “in character” as Hulk Hogan, he would often strike a fictional pose and did not tell the truth, as when he asserted in television and radio interviews in 2012 that he had watched the video on Gawker. He now claims he has never seen it.“I also said I body-slammed Moby Dick and pulled a bumper off a Cadillac,” he said. “It gives you artistic license to be a jerk.”A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Hulk Hogan Takes the Stand in His Trial Against Gawker.
