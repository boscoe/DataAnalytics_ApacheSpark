The Grammy Awards’ television broadcast is going live this year — really live.For years, CBS has delayed its telecast of the Grammys ceremony by three hours for stations on the West Coast, leading to some complaints of spoilers as the winners are discussed on social media.But on Tuesday, CBS, the Grammys’ longtime home on television, said that for this year’s award show, on Feb. 15, it would offer its stations and affiliates in the Pacific and Mountain time zones the option of broadcasting live for the first time in the awards’ history. The show is broadcast from the Staples Center in Los Angeles.“We’ve discussed this with CBS for years, but a variety of factors came together this year, and we collectively agreed that we had the perfect opportunity to try a new model and see how viewers respond,” Neil R. Portnow, the chief executive of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammys, said in a statement.While viewership for the Grammys has been climbing in recent years, the audience for the 2015 awards was 24.8 million, down 13 percent from the year before.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Grammy Awards to Air Live, Even on the West Coast.
