CHENGDU, China — The world’s biggest economies said on Sunday that they would work to support global growth, after a meeting here dominated by discussions of the impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and fears of rising protectionism.Philip Hammond, Britain’s new finance minister, said the uncertainty about the so-called Brexit would begin to abate once Britain laid out a vision for a future relationship with Europe, which could become clearer later this year.“What will start to reduce uncertainty is when we are able to set out more clearly the kind of arrangement we envisage going forward with the European Union,” Mr. Hammond said after the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 major economies.If, he said, “there is a sense perhaps later this year that we are all on the same page in terms of where we expect to be going, I think that will send a reassuring signal to the business community and to markets.”AdvertisementA communiqué issued by the ministers at the end of the two-day meeting said Brexit had added to uncertainty in the global economy, where growth was “weaker than desirable.” It added that members, however, were “well positioned to proactively address the potential economic and financial consequences.”The communiqué went on, “In light of recent developments, we reiterate our determination to use all policy tools — monetary, fiscal and structural — individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.”AdvertisementThe International Monetary Fund this week cut its global growth forecasts because of the Brexit vote.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
