HONG KONG — In a surprise move on Monday, the German authorities withdrew approval for the takeover of a domestic semiconductor firm by a Chinese bidder, a deal that was set to be an emblem of a new push by Chinese companies to acquire cutting-edge technology businesses and a sign of Berlin’s tolerance for such moves.A statement from Aixtron, the German company being bought by Fujian Grand Chip, did not specify a reason for the reversal of the decision by the regulator in Germany. But it comes as concerns rise about Chinese firms taking over leading German tech companies, and with federal elections scheduled for next year.Although Chinese investment in European companies is nothing new, some experts have raised concerns as Chinese funds have shifted focus from ailing businesses to more advanced and successful firms, particularly in Germany. So far this year, the country has been the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Europe, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a research foundation based in Berlin.In an article last month, The New York Times highlighted how a Chinese customer that dropped a large order — in turn crashing Aixtron’s shares — had a relationship with Fujian Grand Chip. The connection did not indicate wrongdoing, but it does illustrate the blurred lines between acquisitive Chinese companies and Chinese industrial policy.AdvertisementMany German companies retain a lead over Chinese competitors, but the wholesale purchase of firms like Aixtron has raised the specter of the technology being spirited away to the supply chain in China, as Beijing details in state economic plans.AdvertisementFor Germany, that could mean a long-term loss of know-how and upper-class jobs. The country is particularly vulnerable because of its large number of highly advanced, small and midsize companies — known as the Mittelstand — that can be taken over more easily and more cheaply than large multinationals.Also this year, the robotics company Kuka — whose orange arms are ubiquitous in highly automated German auto plants — was taken over by the Chinese appliance maker Midea. And this month, Chinese news media said that two Chinese companies were considering a bid for Osram Licht, a Munich-based lighting and semiconductor firm.In its statement, Aixtron said the German Economics Ministry would reopen a review of the proceedings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And they are both recipients of government funds. Although it is not clear whether the two coordinated in any way, they are a product of a new approach that Beijing has taken to develop its semiconductor industry.Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter @paulmozur.Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.A version of this article appears in print on October 25, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Germany Blocks China in Bid for a Tech Firm.
