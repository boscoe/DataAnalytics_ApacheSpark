Jeff Bezos went shopping and now the entire retail industry is scrambling to secure shelf space.Even before Amazon’s deal to buy the upscale grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, changes were in motion for the retail landscape:• Walmart agreed to buy the men’s clothing company Bonobos for $310 million, gaining a conventional retailer with brick-and-mortar locations, and an online ethos.• Target is leading a new investment in Casper, a mattress maker that rose to prominence through e-commerce and plans to announce as soon as today that it has raised $170 million. This round of investment values Casper at approximately $750 million, not including the new investment. Target had offered to buy Casper, but the companies failed to agree on terms.The Amazon deal for Whole Foods is yet another example of the influence of activist investors — or “greedy bastards” as John Mackey, the Whole Foods chief executive, had referred to them.The rise of activist investors and technological change has led to a decline in the tenure and dominion of chief executives.AdvertisementAmazon’s move also illustrates the willingness of Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, to experiment at the risk of failing.AdvertisementWhile other companies hold back, dreading colossal mistakes, Amazon has made bold bets in a way that few others can emulate.So, are we going to see fantastical changes to the way we shop? Possibly.In the short term, we are likely to see Amazon put experimentation into practice, tinkering with how Whole Foods works.Mr. Bezos is “consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer’s eyes,” Farhad Manjoo writes in State of the Art.We can also expect Amazon to push more speedily toward grocery stores without cashiers or checkout lines.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But millions of Americans don’t have an alternative.People with poor credit histories have resorted to subprime auto loans, with high interest rates and hefty fees, to buy a car because they need to get to work or to the doctor’s office.These loans have continued to dog them even after their cars have been repossessed.The lenders, unable to recover the balance of the loans by reselling the cars, have been suing borrowers to collect what remains, sometimes as long as 13 years later.With defaults rising, banking regulators and economists have started to worry about the spillover from the strain of these loans.The fallout for low-income Americans could be worse than it was during the mortgage crisis: They cannot turn in the keys and walk away, like they could with mortgages.Even so, securities tied to the loans are still a profitable and sought-after investment on Wall Street.• Talks to discuss Britain’s departure from the European Union started today. Prime Minister Theresa May is under increasing pressure to soften her “Brexit” plans with calls to keep Britain inside the bloc’s customs union.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
