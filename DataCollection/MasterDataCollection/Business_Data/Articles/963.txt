His first episode had 6.6 million viewers; he averages a little under three million viewers a night.Since Mr. Colbert’s debut, he has gained little traction on his NBC competitor, “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon. Though “The Late Show” is No.2 for the season in total viewers and the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic, in recent weeks Mr. Fallon has come close to beating the combined ratings of Mr. Colbert and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel in the demographic.On Sunday night, “The Late Show” was jam-packed with celebrities — President Obama (in a taped segment), Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Will Ferrell and Megyn Kelly — along with a steady beat of Super Bowl jokes and football skits. The reviews for the hourlong show were mixed.Mr. Colbert went on the air at 10:54 p.m. He was followed by the local news and then James Corden’s “The Late Late Show,” which went on at exactly the time his show normally goes on: 12:37 a.m. He drew five million viewers, a slightly bigger audience than Craig Ferguson got for the post-local news Super Bowl slot in 2013.Advertisement
