It will offer a combination of new British shows, including the crime drama “New Blood,” to American audiences, as well as a collection of recently aired television programs and other shows like “Upstairs Downstairs” and “Fawlty Towers” from the broadcasters’ back catalogs.“The BBC and ITV are the two most prolific content producers and broadcasters in British television,” Ann Sarnoff, president of BBC Worldwide North America, said in a statement on Tuesday when the service was announced. “This will be a must-have service for lovers of British television.”The move by Britain’s two largest broadcasters comes as people around the world have become increasingly reliant on digital streaming services to watch their favorite shows on smartphones or through apps on their internet-enabled televisions.It also represents a step by the BBC and ITV to offer potential American subscribers a legal way to pay for the broadcasters’ content amid widespread use of so-called virtual private networks. That technology permits people to gain direct access to the television programs offered through the companies’ video-on-demand services that are available only in Britain.An estimated 60 million people worldwide, or roughly the same population as Britain, use this technology to watch the BBC’s streaming service called iPlayer, which is available only in Britain, according to GlobalWebIndex, an internet research company.The BBC and ITV did not say how much the new American service would cost, but similar video-on-demand offerings from the likes of HBO and Acorn TV, an online service that also offers British television programming, cost $50 to $180 a year. A spokeswoman for the BBC declined to comment on pricing.AMC Networks, which has a joint venture with the BBC to run BBC America, will hold a minority stake in the new video-on-demand offering.While BritBox will bring new British television shows to the United States, some of the broadcasters’ most popular hits, including “Doctor Who,” will not be immediately available on the new service.Early this year, the BBC pulled “Doctor Who” from both Hulu and Netflix after signing an exclusive deal with Amazon. (The most recent iteration of the series, however, will be available on BBC America.)Despite such limitations, the broadcasters’ executives said they believed there was a large audience across the United States willing to pay to watch the companies’ wide array of programming.“Britain produces some of the best television in the world,” Simon Pitts, ITV’s managing director of online, pay television, interactive and technology, said in a statement. “BritBox will be the best and most comprehensive British streaming service in the U.S.”Follow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.Advertisement
