President-elect Donald J. Trump’s latest missive on military spending suggests that Boeing has perhaps swayed him more than its rival Lockheed Martin. Now, he is preparing to pit one off the other to try to decrease the cost of new fighter jets, military analysts said on Thursday.Mr. Trump’s post on Twitter on Thursday afternoon said that based on the “tremendous cost and cost overruns” on Lockheed’s new F-35 strike fighter jet, he had asked Boeing to give him the price for a “comparable” version of its older F-18 Super Hornet.
            Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!        His post came a day after he had met with the two companies’ chiefs in Florida. It indicated he was receptive to Boeing’s longtime pitch that the Navy should buy more of its F-18s over Lockheed’s F-35s for aircraft carriers.Military analysts said Mr. Trump’s post also sharply raised the pressure on Lockheed to lower the cost of the F-35 program, which is projected to cost $400 billion for 2,400 planes for the Air Force, the Marines and the Navy.AdvertisementHis suggestion that the F-35s and the F-18s were comparable also indicated that Mr. Trump was not yet fully up to speed on the technical characteristics of the jets, some analysts said.Advertisement“The Super Hornet has been the Navy’s most successful carrier-based aircraft, but it doesn’t reflect the latest technological refinements that the F-35 has,” said Loren B. Thompson, who consults for Lockheed and works for a research group that is supported by all the major military contractors.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The F-35s can also fuse intelligence from many sensors and transmit it to other planes. The F-18s, however, can carry more weapons. Based on current prices, the F-18 costs roughly 30 percent less than the F-35.As the cost of the F-35 program soared since its start in 2001, some Navy officials have worried that they could not afford as many F-35s as they would need. Analysts said the Air Force and the Marines still wanted the F-35, but the Navy had been headed toward a mix in which each carrier might have two squadrons of F-35s and two squadrons of F-18s.Mr. Trump’s tweet suggests he could tilt that mix further toward the F-18 if Lockheed does not bring down the cost of the F-35.Lockheed declined to comment. Boeing said it was “committed to working with the president-elect and his administration” on national security needs.A version of this article appears in print on December 23, 2016, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: More Pressure on Lockheed to Cut Price of Fighters.
