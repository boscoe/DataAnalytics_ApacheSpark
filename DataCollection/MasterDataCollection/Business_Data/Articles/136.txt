WASHINGTON — New orders last month in the United States for long-lasting manufactured goods had their biggest drop in 16 months as lower oil prices and a strong dollar pressured factories.Despite the slowdown in growth, which was acknowledged by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, the labor market remains on solid ground. First-time filings for jobless benefits retreated from a six-month high last week, other data showed on Thursday.Economists have expressed worries that the energy industry slump and drag from a strong dollar are spilling over to other parts of the economy, which would lead to continued weakness in early 2016.“U.S. companies are cutting investment sharply, and the key worry is that it seems to be spreading beyond the oil sector,” said Thomas Costerg, a United States economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “And in the meantime, consumers are missing in action, not able to offset the huge drag from the energy sector.”

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders plunged 5.1 percent last month, the biggest drop since August 2014, after slipping 0.5 percent in November. The decline was generally broad-based, with orders for transportation equipment plunging 12.4 percent and bookings for nonmilitary aircraft plummeting 29.4 percent.AdvertisementThe drop in aircraft orders is surprising as Boeing received orders for 223 aircraft in December, up from 89 planes the previous month, according to information posted on its website.AdvertisementNonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 4.3 percent in December, the largest drop in 10 months. These so-called core capital goods orders fell 1.1 percent in November.The decline in orders for durable and capital goods adds to weak data on retail sales, industrial production, exports and business inventories, suggesting that the economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.

Apart from the buoyant dollar and spending cuts by energy companies bruised by the slump in oil prices, the economy has been blindsided by anemic demand overseas and business efforts to trim an inventory overhang. The growth outlook has been dimmed by the recent stock market sell-off.The Fed said on Wednesday that economic growth slowed late last year and noted that business fixed investment has been increasing at a “moderate” pace in recent months.Economists said the dour durable goods orders report could heighten the Fed’s concerns about the impact of global headwinds and the fallout from the dollar, which has gained 11 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since last January.In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 during the week ended Jan. 23. The drop almost reversed the previous two weeks’ increases.It was the 47th consecutive week that claims remained below 300,000, which is associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest stretch since the early 1970s.A version of this list appears in print on January 29, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Orders for Durable Goods Fell 5.1% in December.
