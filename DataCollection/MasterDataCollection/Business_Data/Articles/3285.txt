Viacom reported a 29 percent plunge in profit in the latest fiscal quarter, putting its management in the hot seat as it continues to wage a brutal fight for control of the entertainment company.The lackluster earnings, reported on Thursday, put a harsh spotlight on the actual business results of a company that has been engulfed in legal turmoil over the mental capacity of its controlling shareholder, Sumner M. Redstone. Analysts said a weak report could put more pressure on Viacom’s embattled management to resolve the dispute out of court, while steady results could embolden Viacom executives to continue to fight.It remains to be seen how the latest earnings will ultimately affect settlement talks, but Mr. Redstone’s National Amusements criticized Viacom’s performance, stating it “continues to highlight the need for changes to leadership at the company.” Through National Amusements, a movie theater chain, Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS.Total revenue for Viacom — the owner of the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio — inched up 2 percent, to $3.1 billion, in its last  quarter, Viacom said on Thursday.AdvertisementAdjusted net earnings attributable to Viacom were $419 million, or $1.05 a share, for the three months that ended on June 30, the company’s third fiscal quarter. That compares with $591 million, or $1.47 a share, during the same period last year.AdvertisementIn a conference call on Thursday, Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, briefly addressed the dispute and acknowledged that its public nature has been a distraction, particularly with its efforts to sell a 49 percent stake in Paramount.“Yes, it is a distraction, but in the scope of time it will be viewed as temporary,” Mr. Dauman said. “Our strategic initiatives continue unabated.”Wall Street reacted to Viacom’s results with a sigh. The company’s results beat Wall Street’s most recent, reduced expectations for revenue and profit, and Viacom shares were down about 1 percent at the close of trading on Thursday.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.            “Operations remain under pressure but there are no new negatives,” Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note.The company signaled in June that its profit for the quarter would fall well below what Wall Street had previously expected, attributing the weakness in part to the dismal box-office performance of its film “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.” The company also said that the “highly public governance controversy” had delayed a significant streaming deal.Court battles are being waged in California, Massachusetts and Delaware over whether Mr. Redstone has the mental capacity to make decisions about his businesses. Settlement discussions fell apart just last week after the Massachusetts judge ruled that the trial should go forward.In May, Mr. Redstone unexpectedly ousted his longtime confidants Mr. Dauman and George S. Abrams from the trust that will control his companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. The two men filed suit, challenging the mental capacity of Mr. Redstone, who is 93 and in failing health, and asserting that he had been unduly influenced by his daughter, Shari Redstone.AdvertisementIn June, National Amusements moved to replace five Viacom board members, an action widely considered to be the precursor for ousting Mr. Dauman as chief executive. Viacom’s lead independent director filed suit in Delaware, challenging the shake-up.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He added that the legal developments would “create a better environment” for a Paramount transaction, which National Amusements has opposed.Mr. Dauman said that Viacom had whittled down potential buyers for the Paramount stake to a handful of prospects, but that there had been a slowdown in recent weeks.Mr. Dauman spent most of the call focused on Viacom’s business. He outlined a number of initiatives underway that he characterized as transforming the company. Those include ratings improvements at several TV networks as well as growth in the company’s international businesses.Several of those initiatives have yet to deliver a turnaround.National Amusements criticized Viacom management, stating it “has failed to articulate a credible long‐term plan to reverse the company’s decline.” As proof, it pointed to the 50 percent drop in share price over the two years that ended June 15, when it moved to shake up Viacom’s board. Other factors included declines in ratings and advertising sales.In response, a Viacom spokesman, Carl Folta, took an aim at Ms. Redstone. “Viacom continues to execute on its strategic plan, which is supported by a majority of its independent board,” he said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that one of our directors feels the need to try to damage the company in response to losses in the courtroom.”Viacom said that in the most recent quarter, revenue gains in its filmed entertainment group offset decreases in its media networks group. Sales in Viacom’s media networks segments, which include its TV networks, plunged 22 percent in the quarter because of declines in domestic advertising and affiliate sales.Domestic advertising sales declined 4 percent in the quarter. Price increases were offset by weak ratings at some networks as well as a reduction in advertising units. The results represent a sequential improvement from the previous quarter, when domestic advertising sales declined 5 percent. Mr. Dauman has said that the company expects continued improvement in domestic advertising sales this year.AdvertisementInternational advertising sales increased 13 percent, propelled by growth in Europe.Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom’s chief operating officer, said that while advertising sales during the current quarter would be weaker because of the Olympics, the ad business should be “back on track” in 2017.Domestic affiliate sales declined 10 percent, which the company attributed to a “difficult comparison” with the timing of certain deals the previous year. International affiliate sales increased 9 percent. The company was hurt by foreign exchange rates.Filmed entertainment revenue increased 30 percent to $621 million, bolstered by gains in license fees and theatrical revenue. Global theatrical revenue increased to $91 million. The “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” movie was the company’s big film released in the quarter.Executives said that they expected Paramount to report an operating loss for the current quarter and full year.A version of this article appears in print on August 5, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Viacom Profit Slumps 29%, Hinting at Company’s Drama.
