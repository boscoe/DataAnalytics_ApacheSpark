            While global investors initially shook off the Chinese stock market slump last summer, a surprise currency devaluation later started a rout as concerns mounted about the health of the country’s economy.        JAN. 7, 2016
Seven years ago, the collapsing United States economy laid a dead hand on the rest of the world, a dubious role that was then assumed by Europe, whose sovereign debt crisis often pumped fear around the globe.Now, it appears to be China’s turn to cause havoc far beyond its borders.China’s challenges have been debated for years, but in recent months they have taken on a greater importance in the minds of investors and policy makers. China was the focus when stocks sold off sharply during the summer, and such worries have again driven global markets down in recent days.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, for instance, plunged 2.4 percent on Thursday after the Chinese currency continued to fall and trading was halted on its stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average is now trading 9.8 percent below the all-time nominal high that it reached last year.China’s convulsions have come at an inopportune time. The Federal Reserve recently increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a move that appears to have intensified an exodus from riskier markets. And there are signs of weakness in the United States economy, like the manufacturing sector.
                China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.            The White House said on Thursday that it was monitoring the turbulence in the markets. “Obviously, we’re aware of the kind of volatility that we’ve seen in China over the last several days, and this has had an impact on markets in other countries, including ours,” said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. “So that’s certainly something that we’re closely watching.”AdvertisementChina is in many ways different from the United States or Europe, and its unique strengths and weaknesses are complicating efforts to assess the level of damage that the country might inflict on the rest of the world. This task is made even harder by the enmeshed nature of the world’s markets and economies. Problems in one large country can transmit to other places in several ways — and they may feed on themselves as they do so.AdvertisementBut despite this murkiness, some analysts and economists say they are becoming less optimistic that the United States will remain unscathed by China’s struggles.“If things were to get really disruptive, global growth would stall to where the U.S. would be affected,” said George Goncalves, a rates strategist at Nomura in New York. “These issues started percolating last year and they don’t just go away because the calendar year changed.”The slowing of China’s economy from historically high rates of growth has long been expected to weigh on growth elsewhere. “The China that had been growing at 10 percent for 30 years was a powerful source of fuel for much of what drove the global economy,” said Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. The growth rate has slowed to an official figure of around 7 percent. “That’s a material deceleration,” Mr. Roach said.But investors have long doubted the official numbers. And they are increasingly worried that the Chinese authorities’ handling of the country’s challenges may set off chain reactions that hurt other markets.Much now depends on how China manages the devaluation of its currency, the renminbi. By allowing it to fall against other currencies, the Chinese authorities apparently hope to spur higher exports and reduce imports, bolstering Chinese businesses in the process.Countries devalue all the time without causing too many shock waves. But it is not clear how far the authorities want the currency to fall. “Mere uncertainty about where the exchange rate will ultimately be creates higher risk premiums in financial markets,” said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citigroup’s private bank. “That can diminish when there is stability, but we don’t have stability right now.”And there are ways in which a Chinese devaluation could go wrong. A devaluation could end up being unsettlingly large. China, for instance, slashed the value of the renminbi in 1994, an event that investors have not forgotten.AdvertisementA steep drop in the renminbi could do significant harm to the real economies of other countries. A much cheaper renminbi could, for instance, make it much harder for companies in, say, Indonesia or South Korea to compete in world markets against Chinese rivals. Some countries might then slash the value of their currencies to regain competitiveness, setting off a currency war.In such a scenario, the dollar, as a safe haven currency, would most likely strengthen, creating a headwind for United States corporations that export into global markets. A stronger dollar would make imports into the United States cheaper, potentially intensifying the forces that have pushed inflation down to a level that has made the Federal Reserve nervous. “Inflation is now going to have a hard time rising,” said Mr. Goncalves, the strategist.Fearing that the United States economy might soon sag, investors would most likely clamor for the Fed to hold off on increasing interest rates. A monthslong guessing game over monetary policy could then occur, stoking further uncertainty.Global investors might soon also have to contend with high numbers of defaults in China’s corporate sector. Chinese companies have borrowed billions of dollars in recent years. As the renminbi falls, many companies may find it harder to pay back dollar debts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As a result, such banks may avoid taking the sort of losses they suffered on mortgage bonds during the 2008 financial crisis. Still, rising defaults could harm Chinese investors and banks, creating the sort of headlines that could at least cause global investors to scale back their risk-taking.Still, the current storm in the markets may pass, as it did last year.The recovery going on in the rest of the world may yet survive China’s turbulence. Policy makers in Europe, Japan and the United States can always respond aggressively, as they have done in past crises. The dollar could weaken under such stimulus.And China may just be going through a necessary but bumpy adjustment, not a full-blown shakeout.China may, for instance, be able to manage a steady devaluation and absorb corporate defaults while avoiding a dangerous level of financial instability. Its government, after all, has far deeper pockets than the Europeans at the height of the Continent’s crisis. And on some measures, China is still doing rather well. Growth may be slowing, but the Chinese government may ultimately care more about employment than headline growth figures, said Mr. Roach of Yale. And he noted that China’s jobs numbers had been healthy in recent months. This could be a sign that China’s plan to shift more of its economy away from manufacturing and toward the services sector, which creates more jobs, is bearing fruit. “The bottom line for the economy is that it’s still growing fast enough to create a lot of jobs,” Mr. Roach said.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wave of Economic Turmoil in China Sends Ripples Out to Global Markets.
