Andrew Caspersen, the former Wall Street executive charged by federal prosecutors and securities regulators with defrauding friends, relatives and a charitable foundation closely tied to a large New York hedge fund, is unlikely to face a trial.A lawyer for Mr. Caspersen, 39, who was arrested a little more than two weeks ago and is now hospitalized in Manhattan, told a federal judge on Wednesday that the criminal case against his client would probably be resolved within the next 60 days.“It doesn’t cry out as a triable case,” said Paul Shechtman, a recently hired lawyer for Mr. Caspersen.Mr. Shechtman made his comments during a brief morning hearing in a related fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He told Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan that he anticipated reaching a settlement with securities regulators but was “loath” to enter into any agreement before the criminal case “resolves itself.”
                The S.E.C. said that Andrew Caspersen, a partner at Park Hill, solicited $95 million to invest in a shell company.            Speaking after the hearing, Mr. Shechtman declined to use the word “plea” to describe the anticipated resolution with federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan. But he reiterated that a trial was unlikely.AdvertisementMr. Shechtman recently signed on as Mr. Caspersen’s lawyer, succeeding Daniel Levy, who appeared at his bail hearing on March 28.AdvertisementThe case of Mr. Caspersen, the son of a wealthy financier, Finn Caspersen, has been the talk of much of Wall Street for weeks.Federal authorities accuse Mr. Caspersen, who until recently worked for the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners, of engaging in a scheme to defraud investors of as much as $95 million.An internal investigation by PJT Partners concluded that the amount of money Mr. Caspersen actually took in from investors was about $40 million, of which $14 million came from friends and relatives.The single largest investor was a charitable foundation linked to Louis M. Bacon’s hedge fund and investment firm, Moore Capital Management. Last November, the Moore Charitable Foundation invested nearly $25 million with Mr. Caspersen, who had convinced investors that he was working on deals to raise money for clients of Park Hill Advisors, which works with private equity firms and hedge funds.The PJT internal investigation found that Mr. Caspersen began soliciting money from investors for his unauthorized investment vehicles in late 2014. These activities continued right up until his arrest.Federal authorities said at least half of the money Mr. Caspersen took in from the Moore foundation was lost by Mr. Caspersen on aggressive stock options trading in a personal brokerage account.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The letter from prosecutors requesting the bail adjustment noted that Mr. Caspersen remained “hospitalized in a secure unit” in a Manhattan hospital.As part of his bail, Mr. Caspersen was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and potential alcohol treatment. His $5 million bond is secured by the home that Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Christina, own in Bronxville, N.Y., and $1 million in cash.The couple, who have two young children, also own a co-op apartment in Manhattan.The magistrate judge required three people who know Mr. Caspersen to sign on as “responsible persons” on the $5 million bond in the event he fails to appear in court as required. Mr. Caspersen’s wife, his brother Finn and one of his Princeton classmates, Beau Brauer, signed the agreement. Mr. Caspersen graduated from Princeton in 1999.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Wall Street Scion’s Fraud Case Could Be Settled, His Lawyer Says.
