The Thomas Cole National Historic Site in Catskill, N.Y., will open its recreated New Studio on May 1 with the exhibition “Thomas Cole: The Artist as Architect,” through Oct. 30. The original New Studio, built in 1846, was designed by Cole and demolished in 1973 before the site became a museum. The reconstruction of the Italianate building affords the site a museum-quality space for displaying art and enhances the home of Cole, founder of the Hudson River School art movement.The New Studio (above) is on its original footprint across the lawn from the artist’s home. The exterior replicates the space that Cole designed as his work space for the last year of his life. The gallery will be used to highlight his influence on American art. The coming exhibition will be the first to focus on his little-known architectural achievements, including the design for the Ohio State Capitol.A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2016, on Page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: On the Horizon; An Artist’s Studio.
