The 19th-century neighborhood, originally known as the city exposition district and inspired by the 1889 Paris World’s Fair, had by the late 1990s become infamous for its abandoned factories and alarming crime rate. Today, a new generation of hopeful, innovative Guatemaltecos has reclaimed Cuatro Grados Norte and converted it into the city’s pre-eminent cultural and gastronomic zone, filled with vibrant street art, coffee shops, tech incubators, artisan cooperatives and chef-owned restaurants.The craft beer movement has been slow to arrive in Guatemala, but this standout spot has found a home and outsize reputation. Set in the intimate lower level of the Casa del Águila Cultural Center, the microbrewery serves artisanal lagers, I.P.A.s, hefeweizens and coffee stouts as well as sausages.Ruta 3, Vía 5 esquina, Zona 4, Interior Casa del Águila; 502-4810-2260; facebook.com/elprincipegrisEach section of this playful hall serves a different cuisine.
