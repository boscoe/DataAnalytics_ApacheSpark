Hilton Worldwide has announced a new hotel brand today, Tru by Hilton, that is positioned to be the first design-forward hotel chain in the midscale category where rooms start at $80.The new brand, the 13th  in Hilton’s portfolio, aims to capture travelers who it says shares a “millennial mind-set,” or an interest in value, simplicity and experience running across generations from millennials to baby boomers.Picture a Quality Inn or a Comfort Inn with a makeover along the lines of an Ace hotel, without the hipster restaurants, and you may have Tru by Hilton, which features bright colors, a lobby designed with areas for eating, playing games, working and lounging and efficiently designed guest rooms.“The rooms got smaller and the lobby got bigger,” said Phil Cordell, global head of Hilton Worldwide’s focused service brands, highlighting the social aspects of the new concept.AdvertisementServing as a gateway to the hotel’s 98 rooms, the 2,770-square-foot lobby, called the Hive, includes a game area with Ping-Pong or foosball tables with stadium seating and a large-screen TV; a lounge area with furniture guests can move around; work spaces with sound-insulated nooks; and an eating area including a market selling snacks and drinks, like beer and wine. It also houses a fitness center.AdvertisementIncluded in the room rate, the free breakfast bar will offer 30 toppings ranging from almond butter to candy sprinkles to pair with Greek yogurt, oatmeal, bagels, English muffins or unfrosted doughnuts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Designers maximized the smaller spaces with an open closet opposite hooks for hanging clothes. Eight-foot-wide windows provide a sense of openness. Amenities include a 55-inch TV, a minirefrigerator and up to a dozen electrical outlets.The new brand, “promises to offer a more stylish experience than Hilton’s other midscale brand, Hilton Garden Inn,” Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, wrote in an email. “Hilton has clearly developed Tru to increase its appeal and relevance to younger generations of travelers, especially those between 21 and 40, to whom the Hilton Garden Inn brand may appear dated or simply boring.”Hilton says it has 102 contracts on the books and expects the first Tru by Hilton to open later this year. The company is focusing on the domestic market with early locations set for Nashville, Charlotte, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Denver and Dallas.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
