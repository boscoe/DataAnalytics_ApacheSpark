But by the 1960s, the vibrant shopping thoroughfare was just one of many rundown streets in Manila. Now Escolta is having a revival. Young artists are skipping Manila’s more mainstream galleries to exhibit on the street. A collective of visual artists holds a seasonal flea market there. Historic preservationists, too, are rallying on social media to revitalize the fallen business district, which feels a bit like a time warp, with fine examples of Art Deco, Beaux-Arts and neo-Classical architecture.The working space of the multidisciplinary artist Derek Tumala, left, which opened last June, showcases select pieces of his Slaves of Liberty line of clothing and stationery, including a reversible bolero, a mesh trench and tote bags.
