They can also change their destination and use the full value of their original tickets for new tickets on KLM, Air France and/or Delta Air Lines without paying a change fee. (Air France, KLM and Delta code share.)In addition, they are entitled to a full refund if they are scheduled to travel to, from or through Brussels between March 22 and 31 if their flight was canceled by these airlines or delayed for more than three hours, and they did not travel.If they bought their ticket on KLM.com, a KLM ticket office or through KLM telephone reservations, and the ticket number starts with 074, they can apply for a refund online. For tickets purchased from a travel agent, travelers should contact that agent directly.Lufthansa had two flights from Frankfurt and Munich on the way to Brussels when the attacks happened; these were rerouted to Liège or Cologne. Customers who have a ticket for a flight to and from Brussels between March 22 and 28 are permitted one rebooking or cancellation free of charge; this policy is valid for all airlines that are part of the Lufthansa Group — Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings.United Airlines had two arrivals scheduled from the United States to Brussels this morning. The first, flight 950 from Washington Dulles, arrived at 7:01 a.m., and customers deplaned normally at the gate. The second, flight 999 from Newark Liberty, was rerouted to a remote location according to spokesman Charles Hobart.For customers ticketed to or from Brussels through March 31, the airline will waive change fees and any differences in fare for travel rebooked to the city through April 12; these customers can also rebook their existing Brussels itineraries to arrive in or depart from Amsterdam, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Luxembourg or Paris.Delta Air Lines also had one landing in Brussels this morning — Flight DL80 from Atlanta; a second flight to the city from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York was diverted to Amsterdam.

The change fee will be waived for travel rescheduled after March 31, but a difference in fare may apply.Meanwhile, one airline isn’t being as accommodating to its customers in Brussels looking to leave: the British newspaper The Independent reported today that Ryanair told a group of 28 British passengers in Brussels who wanted to change their flights out of the city from Wednesday to this evening that the charge for the switch would be £214 (about $308) each, a total of almost £6,000. The group chose not to make the change, according to The Independent.Regardless of airline policies, travel insurance may protect Brussels-bound travelers, said Stan Sandberg, a founder of the insurance comparison site TravelInsurance.com. Many travel insurance plans offer trip cancellation coverage for terrorist attacks that are recognized as such by the United States State Department, provided the coverage is purchased before the terrorist attack, he said; the typical cancellation coverage will apply to travelers who are scheduled to travel within seven to 30 days of the attack.“Unfortunately, cancellation coverage can no longer be purchased to protect against travel to Brussels, but for travelers with an existing trip cancellation plan who are already in Brussels, trip interruption coverage might be available,” he said.Brussels Charleroi Airport, also known as Brussels South Charleroi Airport and located an hour away from the city center, is open, but travelers are advised to arrive at least four hours in advance of their flight, according to the airport’s site; this airport services routes within Europe.Advertisement
