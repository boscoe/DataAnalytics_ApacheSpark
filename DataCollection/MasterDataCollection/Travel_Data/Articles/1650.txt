Deprivation isn’t the point of these getaways: instead of calorie-restricted diets and hours of punishing workouts, these options emphasize balance, a sense of place and most importantly, pleasure. In fact, at most, imbibing isn’t off-limits — it is even encouraged.ToneEscapes, for one, is a new company offering five small group retreats throughout the year in locales like Marbella, Spain; Santorini, Greece; and Saint Lucia. Mantas Zvinas, the company’s founder and a certified personal trainer and yoga instructor in New York City, said that the trips are meant to be the opposite of a boot camp. “I want to teach people a sustainable lifestyle where you workout moderately and absolutely enjoy a glass or two of wine and reasonable portions of sweets,” he said.Like all ToneEscapes retreats, the one in Marbella, from March 23 to 29, will have morning workouts that incorporate the surrounding environment, like bike rides along the Andalucia Coast and hikes through the Sierra de las Nieves mountains. Afternoons include visits to historic villages and meeting local olive oil and wine producers. Meals will emphasize the abundance of seafood and produce in the area, and local wine will be served at lunch and dinner. Prices start at $3,900 a person, inclusive of accommodations, meals, workouts, excursions, activities, local transportation and one spa treatment.

Anna Kaiser, a certified personal trainer and the owner of the New York City workout studios AKT, created four 2018 trips with the purpose of teaching participants how to develop lifelong healthy habits in a fun setting. One retreat, in Nicaragua from May 6 to 11, for example, will have a schedule of morning workouts that includes interval classes, volcano hikes and kayaking in the Pacific Ocean. Afternoons feature cooking classes on Nicaraguan cuisine and sightseeing tours. Meals will highlight local ingredients. Prices start at $3,200 a person, inclusive of accommodations, meals, workouts, excursions, local transportation and one spa treatment.
