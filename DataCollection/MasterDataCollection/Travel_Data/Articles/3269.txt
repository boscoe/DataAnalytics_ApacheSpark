The small Dutch city of ‘s-Hertogenbosch, known as Den Bosch, is celebrating the virtual return of its native son Hieronymus Bosch, who died 500 years ago. Although the city doesn’t own any of the artist’s paintings, this year it will present the largest retrospective of Bosch’s work ever, with all the works on loan from several leading museums. “Jheronimus Bosch – Visions of Genius,” displaying 20 paintings and 19 drawings, runs from Feb. 13 to May 8 at Het Noordbrabants Museum. Seven other museums in the province of North Brabant will present shows.In its elegant Baroque center and along its canal system, Den Bosch is pulling out the stops for visitors, with events throughout the year including nightly light shows on the market square, projected 3-D images of diabolical Bosch characters, themed canal tours and rare climbs outside St. John’s Cathedral, covered with fantastical gargoyles and sculptures.A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2016, on Page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: The Art of Bosch  .
