So many places to go, right? But also so many ways to get to them. Here are a few to look out for this year.The Venice-Simplon Orient Express, that legendary long-distance passenger train service immortalized by Agatha Christie, Bram Stoker and countless others, is reinstating its historic route between London, Paris and Berlin in restored 1920s Art Deco carriages. The two-day overnight journey, which starts at $3,359 per person and includes meal service, a bar car with live piano music and afternoon tea service, makes its inaugural departure from London to Berlin via Paris on June 2.After 17 years of boring through the Swiss Alps, the Gotthard Base rail tunnel — among the world’s longest and deepest tunnels — will open this year, ahead of schedule. The 35-mile-long mega-tunnel connects Switzerland’s Swiss-German-speaking Canton Uri to Italian-speaking Ticino before continuing to Lake Como and Milan. New high-speed trains, introduced in 2014, will begin to run through the tunnel, reducing Zurich to Milan transit from four hours to just under three hours; another tunnel opening in 2020 will shave off another 30 minutes. The old tracks will still function as local lines, some becoming new scenic routes for tourists.

Several international carriers and domestic carriers have added routes to it in the last year and are scheduled to continue expansion in 2016.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In February, Ecoventura will launch the 20-passenger Origin, and Un-Cruise will begin service on the 48-guest La Pinta. They join the 90-passenger Santa Cruz II from Metropolitan Touring, which started in October 2015.Up north, in the Scottish Highlands, the new North Coast 500 highway promises landscapes of lush mountains, looming castles and lovely seaside villages. The 500-mile circular course starts in the northern city of Inverness, then snakes along the rugged coastline, weaving along the west coast and some of the most northerly coastal points before heading south again through Dingwall.AdvertisementCHARLY WILDER, ELAINE GLUSAC, ADAM H.
