The pair, both from Madrid, also run restaurants in the province of Cádiz in southwest Spain and have worked at restaurants abroad, bringing home what they learned in countries like Italy and China.During a recent visit, first in their parade of shareable dishes was a bowl of hummus dotted with pumpkin seeds and chives, offered at no charge. Then it was on to the Instagram-worthy salad of bright purple trevisano leaves and thinly sliced zucchini and white and green asparagus, hiding a soft ball of burrata and dotted with a house-made black truffle oil. Spring was alive on the plate.Next up, two dazzlers: octopus carpaccio with a topping of fried corn, diced yucca and a white wine and garlic sauce, and potato salad mixed with apple dressing and green apple slivers.But my favorites were the handful of tuna dishes, using the high-quality fish found in Malta and southern Spain, that followed on plates inspired by Southeast Asia and Mexico. Tuna satay — skewered chunks of loin resting on crunchy romaine hearts — danced with fresh mint, cilantro and basil leaves, and a spicy peanut sauce. Zippier were the duo of tacos, a tangle of diced tuna cheek, pineapple, onion, cilantro, tomatoes and habanero spilling out of hard corn shells.Italy was represented in a more traditional way: a satisfying bowl of spiral pasta in a pesto and tomato sauce, the ultimate comfort food.Sweetness is welcome after these jolts of flavor, and the dense chocolate cake served with raspberry sorbet and drizzled with a warm caramel sauce did the job.The second-floor dining room offers a slightly subdued atmosphere; the livelier entry level and its three communal tables is the better pick for a vibe more suited to a classic tapas experience.KultO Calle Ibiza, 4; 34-911-733-053; kulto.es. Average dinner for two, without drinks or tip, is about 55 euros ($61).Advertisement
