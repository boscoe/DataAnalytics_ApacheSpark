            Explore the map and find things to do in Rome.        For old-school Roman cuisine, these places are in top form. At the tourist-free end of Trastevere, Ristorante la Tavernaccia da Bruno (Via G. Da Castelbolognese; 63; 39-06-581-2792) serves all your classic dishes but also has great ravioli and vignarola. Call for reservations; the secret has long been long out.In Testaccio, the city’s capital of traditional Roman trattorias, the locals-only attitude has been replaced with a cool-kid chill. But neither were in evidence at Piatto Romano (Via G. B. Bodoni, 62; 39-06-6401-4447), where the service was warm and the food top notch.For more sophisticated, or at least different, fare, head north to Marzapane (Via Velletri, 39; 39-06-6478-1692), where the young Spanish chef has wowed city foodies. Make reservations way in advance. If the restaurant is booked, try your luck at the nearby Pro Loco (Via Bergamo 18; 39-06-841-4136), which is more casual, but also excellent.At Retrobottega (Via della Stelletta, 4; 39-06-6813-6310), watch chefs meticulously craft inventive dishes in an open kitchen. The restaurant is serious about its food and “it place” vibe.AdvertisementSan Saba is a quiet part of town, but Saba Caffè e Cucina (Via di S. Saba, 32; 39-06-8775-3176) pulses with life. Go for an unexpectedly excellent lunch on a Sunday where tables of families mix with the fashionable folks who have perfected the long, lingering afternoon.AdvertisementThere is no end to the places to pop into for a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing, or doing nothing.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Macro Museum of Contemporary Art (Via Nizza, 138; 39-06-0608) has intriguing exhibitions, but has also breathed new life into a formerly stuffy neighborhood.The past and the present meet at Hotel Lunetta (Piazza del Paradiso, 68; 39-06-6839-5056) in the center of Rome, where guests can book time in a basement spa with hydromassage and water blades, sauna and massage rooms, all while looking through the glass walls at the remains of the Theater of Pompey.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
