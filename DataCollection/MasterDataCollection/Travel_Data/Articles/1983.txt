Now it is just as likely to be the alt-district of Chapinero Alto, where graffiti scruffs up an orange brick mix of stately Tudor-style homes and blocky modern apartment buildings. The once-residential neighborhood abuts the sleek financial district, but its cheaper rents allow bold entrepreneurs to take more risks, even alongside the older family shops, or tiendas. From restaurants to indie boutiques, the vibe is original and proudly Colombian.This inviting reading room in the boutique Book Hotel is an outpost of a bookstore whose name translates roughly to “The Rabbit Hole.” Patrons can linger with cups of tea in a room with a stone fireplace and antique furniture.Carrera 5 No. 57-79, 57-1-745-9988, thebookhotel.co.This boutique makes a play on “rola,” the local term for Bogotano, a city resident. Since opening in 2013 it has had fun selling bright socks and dark, punky leather-and-lace sweatshirts by three dozen indie designers.Carrera 7 No. 54 A-48, 57-1-212-4569, facebook.com/larockn.rola.Life and death are both on the table at this two-year-old microbrewery, where fresh buds are displayed in skull vases. But the au courant patrons thrill to music (swinging from Frank Sinatra to electronic dance), food (onions sizzling on an outdoor grill) and beer (like a witbier featuring the tang of lulo, a citrusy fruit).Calle 54 No. 6-23, 57-1-466-0842, facebook.com/statuarota.Named for a childhood game, this three-year-old restaurant toys with food for sophisticated grown-ups. With its desk chairs and a list of specials spelled out in alphabet magnets, the spot feels like an old-fashioned schoolhouse — if the teacher’s desk were replaced with a well-curated bar and its lunchroom served lamb neck and rabbit ragout, left.Calle 54A No. 4-13, 57-1-702-6367, salvopatria.com.Olga Visbal, an architect, designed this bakery in 2013 after she began baking herself; artisanal bread was unusual in this city, where factory-made slices were standard. Within the lush skylit atrium, nibble her buttery pastries while watching the stylish neighborhood denizens.Calle 66 Bis No. 4-63, 57-1-248-2062, arboldelpan.tumblr.com.Advertisement
