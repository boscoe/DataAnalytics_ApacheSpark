The Costa Rica Marriott in San Jose recently introduced a Candlelight Experience at its Kuö Spa, with massages that involve substances like volcanic ash. These are set in the property’s 30-acre coffee plantation beneath Arabica trees (the Candlelight Experience costs $50 with the purchase of any spa treatment). In St. Lucia, Capella Marigot Bay offers lunar-based spa treatments during the full and new moon cycles ($210 for two hours).The One&Only resort in the Wolgan Valley, Australia, has an after-dark bush trip in which guests can see possums, wombats and gliding marsupials, and observe the nocturnal behavior of kangaroos, wallabies and wallaroos ($30 per person).To encourage after-hours creativity, Kimpton’s Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa in Palm Beach, Fla., has partnered with Delray Beach-based Vino Van Gogh for a night of painting under the stars ($50 a person).Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor of hospitality and tourism at the Tisch Center at New York University, says travelers want to pack more activities into a 24-hour period, adding: “Activities that have the drama of after-hours lighting or ambience can be more desirable than the same types of programming offered during the day.”Advertisement
