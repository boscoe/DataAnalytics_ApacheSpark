With a population of 200,000, Kosovo’s chief metropolis is also the hub of Europe’s youngest national population; the average age of a Kosovar is 28. The vortex of this energetic destination is the pedestrian-only Bulevardi Nene Tereza (Mother Teresa Boulevard). Radiating from the promenade, named for the recently canonized Albanian nun and bookended by the Yugoslavian-era Grand Hotel and National Theater, is a tangle of streets crowded with cafes, boutiques, fashionable locals, in-the-know internationals and the case for yet another superlative: coolest neighborhood in the Balkans.This year-old spot is the unofficial clubhouse for a neighborhood leaning into its reinvigoration with nerdy swagger. For-sale books and albums anchor one end of an interior with exposed-brick walls and a vaulted ceiling. Titles by countercultural novelists and poets like Charles Bukowski and Oscar Wilde sit next to 1980s-era cult-rock recordings by Tom Waits and Joe Jackson, all in a multipurpose space that works as a restaurant, bar, weekend disco and courtyard exhibition space.St. Fazil Grajqevci 32; 381-38-748-818; somabookstation.comThe deli-cafe, which opened this year, has a clutch of wooden tables set on its leafy patio. A glass case displays homemade quiches and cheesecakes. The namesake tartines are open-faced, whole-grain bread concoctions loaded with inventive combinations of vegetables and cheeses, like caramelized nectarine, mozzarella, and homemade pesto (3.20 euros, about $3.38).Hajdar Dushi 12; 386-049-151-000; facebook.com/Tartine-996321890415572This museum, housed in an Ottoman-era home built in the 18th and 19th centuries, provides a peephole back to the centuries of dovetailing styles and cultures that make up today’s Pristina, including its rituals, clothes, tools, and its handmade intricacies.Rruga Zija Prishtina; facebook.com/MuzeuetnologjikThis workshop’s elegant creations, costing thousands less than they would in Western Europe, include evening dresses and men’s velvet blazers using Marconi fabric. Last year, the designer and owner, Yllka Brada, a 29-year-old Kosovar who studied in France, opened her atelier on Bulevardi Nene Tereza to the public and by appointment.Sheshi Zahir Pajaziti, 1 Hyrja 5/17; 377-45-410-047; facebook.com/ybrada/The ingredients on the menu at this veggie-only oasis are bought daily at the green market on the boulevard’s north end. They become salads like the Zesty Bean, or the Cabbage and Ginger. The Falafel Wrap, a meal on its own, is stuffed with hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, cucumber, and yogurt.Rruga Garibaldi 6; 386-49-886-214; facebook.com/pages/Babaghanoush/1406019369637456Advertisement
