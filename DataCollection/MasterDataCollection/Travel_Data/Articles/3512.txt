Because it’s such a vast country, we decided to run a few additional pieces to invite readers to explore America’s northern neighbor. Here are five stories meant to inspire journeys to Canada.

Timothy Taylor responded with an epic take on the improvised work-in-progress that is Vancouver. Great Bear Lake is the eighth largest lake in the world — bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior. Many have not heard of it but some of the Sahtuto’ine who manage it believe a prophecy that says the lake may become the last refuge for humanity.

Afua Cooper, a scholar and author, wrote about three museums in Ontario. “I have been visiting these places for more than 20 years,” she wrote, “and each time I feel as if I am walking through living history.” Kal Penn seems an unlikely source for insider’s tips on Toronto, but the actor knows a thing or two about the city. He shot the film “Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle” there and returned recently to shoot an ABC series. He shared his favorite neighborhood in Toronto and passed along other recommendations for traveling the world. Canada topped our list of 52 Places to Go this year, and to get readers immersed, we sent a journalist there to shoot 360-degree video.
