Though the Pokémon critters tend to move around, using the filter during a room search shows the number of Pokémon within a radius of about 500 feet at the time of the search, specifying the type and number of Pokémon in that range. The website, which aims to function like the Google of accommodations searches, compiling all rooms available in a location from Couchsurfing and Airbnb accommodations to hotels and houseboats, also notes the proximity of stationary Poke “gyms” and “Poké stops,” places where players may spend more time.While Pokémon players have annoyed some Poké stop neighbors, a number of hotels have embraced their transient game-playing visitors. The historic Hotel Del Coronado near San Diego is home to seven Poké stops, the Peninsula Tokyo has two Poké stops including one at its 24th-floor restaurant and the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco has a Poké stop near its Kanpai Lounge, offering a Pokémon happy hour from 5 to 7 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays with $5 cocktails.Going further afield, Geckos Adventures is offering a new series of trips called “Pokémon: Let’s Go.” Led by local guides who are also versed in the game, the trips visit Peru, the Galapagos, Egypt and Cambodia. Prices start at $607 a person for 12 days of Pokémon hunting in Cambodia. The outfitter is bundling all four destinations in one six-week trip price at $7,500 a person, departing Aug. 28.Advertisement
