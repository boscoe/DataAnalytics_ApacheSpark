But getting behind the wheel, especially for longer trips, calls for skills and preparation. According to Allstate Roadside Services, younger drivers were the ones most likely to have car trouble when on the road.Here are some tips to consider before your trip.Know How to Change a Tire“Changing a tire can be a daunting task, but is actually quite straightforward with the right tools and preparation,” said Sarah Robinson, a Michelin tire safety expert. Ms. Robinson recommends “evaluating the task start to finish, before you even begin.” This includes making sure you are in a safe location and that you have the proper tools to change the flat.Directions on how to change a tire are on this Bridgestone Tire page, along with an instructional video.AdvertisementIf you are unsure, reach out to a roadside assistance provider, like AAA (if you are a member); car insurance providers like Geico, AllState, Nationwide, State Farm and Farmers all offer emergency roadside assistance options, as do some car purchase packages.AdvertisementMs. Robinson added that “many flat tires can be prevented altogether with proper tire maintenance, so try to avoid the situation by checking out your tires once a month.”Pack an Emergency Kit In case you do get stranded while waiting for roadside assistance, an emergency kit will come in handy.AAA suggests keeping a year-round version in your car with the following:Mobile phone and chargerWarning devices (flares or triangles)First aid kitJumper cablesFlashlight and extra batteriesPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
