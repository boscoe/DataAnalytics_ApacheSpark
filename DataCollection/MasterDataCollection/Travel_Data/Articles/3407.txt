PRAGUE — A visit to the Palladium shopping center in central Prague might make you think that the Czech capital has been overrun by international mega-brands. But just behind that mall hides the small but noteworthy neighborhood of Petrska ctvrt, or Peter’s quarter, a quiet residential district with a blossoming local design scene.Tucked up against the broad Vltava River and bordered by Revolucni, Na Porici and Tesnov streets, Petrska started earning attention in 2011, with the opening of the influential Asian restaurant Sansho (Petrska 25), owned by Paul Day, a former sous-chef at Nobu London.Still going strong today, Sansho has since been joined by a sister cafe and butcher shop, Maso a Kobliha (Petrska 23), or “meat and doughnut,” where you can grab a pick-me-up cappuccino (65 koruna, or about $3) and one of the cafe’s namesake kobliha doughnuts (60 koruna), before photographing the neighborhood’s stately Church of St. Peter.One block away, you’ll find an intimate — as in tiny — handbag shop called Luciela Taschen (Petrska 10). Originally from Slovakia, the designer Lucia Jamrichova works with modern shapes and materials highlighted by a rich palette of earth tones, like her oversize purses of leather and cork-lined canvas (7,000 koruna), as well as a “redesigned” line inspired by her customers’ old favorites, like the charming Mila bag (6,300 koruna), modeled on a boxy leather purse brought back from Libya in the 1980s.AdvertisementAt the next corner, you’ll spot Lavmi (Zlatnicka 12), where a neighborhood resident, Babeta Ondrova, creates wallpapers and home décor with geometric shapes and muted colors that echo abstract midcentury designs: a linen-cotton table runner (790 koruna), covered in a light gray or red “sticks” motif, might remind you of something from “The Jetsons” or a classic Blue Note jazz album.Though the 33-foot rolls of Lavmi’s colorful wallpapers (1,285 koruna or 1,870 koruna) are only a few inches thick, they’re still about 21 inches wide. Your carry-on might have an easier time with pillowcases (690 to 860 koruna) or hand towels (345 koruna), and the shop offers shipping to many countries.AdvertisementFind more cool gifts around the corner at Stoclass (Soukenicka 30), sometimes written as 100Class, where the owner, Vendula Stoklaskova, carries a rotating (and whimsical) selection of products from local and regional makers. The current selection includes fluffy wool scarves (1,980 koruna) from the Czech textile designer Katerina Soukupova, as well as “paper” clutches (860 koruna) and cosmetics bags (1,860 koruna) from Austria’s Langackerhäusl.Even high-end men’s wear is catching on. On the same street, you’ll find Leo Macenauer (Soukenicka 13), where bespoke shirts start around 3,500 koruna; farther down the block you’ll find the sleek, light-filled showroom of Janek (Soukenicka 3), whose custom shirts start at 2,690 koruna. The newest arrival, Galard (Petrska 4), started selling its made-to-measure line just off the neighborhood’s main square this year (custom shirts from 3,190 koruna).While busy Revolucni street houses shops like Naoko (Revolucni 24), a source for quirky housewares, Petrska’s magic thrives on its narrow lanes at places like Showroom (Klimentska 3), a site for a coterie of indie designers, several of whom have ateliers in the back of the shop. Look for the asymmetrical dresses in bamboo-viscose fabric (2,800 koruna) by Eiri, or the deconstructed women’s parka in cotton and wool (7,400 koruna) from the house brand Soolista, run by the boutique’s founder, Zuzana Hartlova.Petrska is small enough to cover in just a few hours, but that doesn’t mean you won’t want to stop for a bite. While many Prague restaurants are trying to chase foreign trends, Next Door (Zlatnicka 3) elevates Czech classics like beef tenderloin in cream sauce (245 koruna) and veal schnitzel (345 koruna) to an international standard — in perfect step with the ethos of the surrounding neighborhood.A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2017, in The International New York Times.
