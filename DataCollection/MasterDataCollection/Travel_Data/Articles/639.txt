Following a series of landslides and a bridge collapse in early February, which led to the temporary closing of many hotels and restaurants and put tourism to the region at a standstill, much of Big Sur in California is once again welcoming travelers.Big Sur spans a roughly 90-mile stretch of Highway 1, from San Simeon to Carmel, and attracts more than three million visitors a year, according to Rob O’Keefe, the chief marketing officer for the Monterey County Convention & Visitors Bureau (most of Big Sur is in Monterey County); travelers come to enjoy the spectacular vistas of the Pacific, hike in the parks and savor a remoteness that few destinations in the country offer.Around 35 miles of this portion of Highway 1 are still closed to vehicles, said Susana Cruz, a public information officer for the California Transportation Department. All of the inaccessible area is south of the 310-foot-long Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge, which was destroyed in the landslides; the bridge is being rebuilt and is expected to be open again by mid to late September, Ms. Cruz said.Right now, a 10-mile section of Highway 1 south of the bridge is accessible to cars via a detour on Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, a remote route with no cell service, gas stations or other services. The road adds an additional hour of driving time to reach destinations off Highway 1, and Ms. Cruz advised traveling on it only during daylight hours.AdvertisementBy July, however, Ms. Cruz said, an additional 25 miles of the highway should be accessible to motorists through Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. “We’re working on clearing the landslides so that most of the road is open,” she said.AdvertisementBut even now, with a lengthy detour and the bridge closed for at least three more months, travelers shouldn’t be deterred from visiting Big Sur, said Kate Daniels, the chief of staff to the Fifth District Monterey County supervisor, Mary Adams (the Fifth District includes Big Sur). “The message that we want to get out is that there’s plenty that’s open in Big Sur,” she said. “The area, and the locals who work in the tourism industry, have suffered, and the support of visitors is crucial to the destination’s recovery.”Rick Aldinger, the general manager of Big Sur River Inn, north of the bridge, said that although the 22-room hotel with a 250-seat restaurant was open, it wasn’t business as usual. “Our hotel is usually completely full, and our restaurant is always packed,” he said, “but now that’s not the case because many people don’t realize that we’re open.”In fact, most hotels and restaurants north of Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge are open, according to Ms. Daniels, and so are some campsites and hiking trails.It’s the opposite story south of the bridge, where most hotels, attractions and other businesses remain closed. Brent Marshall, the Monterey district superintendent for California State Parks, said that while some campsites in the state parks are open, most hiking trails within the parks are closed. “We’re working to get some of the trails reopened in a few weeks,” he said. Visitors should check the California State Parks website for updates.The several businesses open south of Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge include Post Ranch Inn, a 40-room luxury hotel, whose guests are being flown in by helicopter from Monterey Regional Airport. Mike Freed, the hotel’s managing partner, said he made the decision to reopen in late April, after being closed since mid-February, because he wanted to keep his staff employed and because he thinks that Big Sur is as picturesque as it has ever been. “Our property is lush and green, and there are colorful wildflowers everywhere,” he said. “Highway 1 is considered to be one of the most beautiful drives in the world, but now you can see that same beauty by walking on the highway,” he said. “When else would you have the opportunity to do that?”Here, a rundown of some of the sites and hotels currently open in Big Sur.
