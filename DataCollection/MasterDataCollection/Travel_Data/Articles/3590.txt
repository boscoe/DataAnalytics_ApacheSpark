CreditLottie Hedley for The New York Times        WHITE ISLAND, New Zealand — A foul smell hangs in the air over White Island, a marine volcano in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty, and steam hisses from rocks stained bright yellow from centuries of sulfur exposure. In a country that revels in its association with the “Lord of the Rings” movies, J. R. R. Tolkien’s orcs and elves wouldn’t appear out of place here.The island is New Zealand’s most active volcano: It has smoked continuously for centuries according to Maori lore, and Capt. James Cook observed it in 1769 during his first voyage in the Pacific. Visitors see steam clouds and bubbling mud but no lava — although there was a major eruption in 2000 and minor ones in 2012 and 2013.It is also one of the world’s more accessible marine volcanoes, only 30 miles offshore from the small coastal town of Whakatane, making it a popular tourist destination.Getting to White Island by boat involves a 90-minute trip, followed by a dinghy transfer to the island for a three-hour visit. A guide distributed gas masks and yellow hard hats to the approximately 40 tourists on my trip, and warned them to stick to the track. Steam vents crack the surface in many directions and a misplaced step could release a blast of scalding air or even pitch the visitor into a newly opened crevice.AdvertisementBrilliant colors and pungent odors assault the senses. On this particular day, there was a stunning contrast between the bright yellow rock and the cloudless blue sky. Then the wind changed direction and a cloud of acrid smoke enveloped the group. Tears streamed as people coughed and reached for their gas masks.AdvertisementBradley J. Scott, a volcanologist with GNS Science, a geoscience agency in New Zealand, said that the sulfuric gas was unpleasant but not harmful.“The levels of gas that are experienced at White Island are irritation level rather than fatal,” he said in an interview. “You’ll have irritation in the throat and the nose but you’re not going to be gassed on the island,” he added, because the fumes are diluted in the air.The island is only little more than a mile in diameter, so it doesn’t take long to see much of the terrain. And while the volcano looks like a smoking cone from a distance — just what you would expect a volcano to look like — one side of the crater has collapsed, so visitors can avoid a steep climb.The main attraction is a large crater complex, with a lake that is filled with a toxic mix of water, mud and gases (and was colored bright orange and yellow during my visit).The water is extremely acidic — the pH level sometimes drops below zero; the median for drinking water is 7.5, on a scale of zero to 14 — but surprisingly, it hosts a range of microscopic life that has adapted to the extreme conditions. “Scientists have actually been able to isolate quite a lot of species living in the crater lake, and they give it a lot of its color,” Mr. Scott said. “They react with the sulfides and the sulfates; that’s what they thrive on.”Over all, however, White Island is an inhospitable place. A few stunted trees stand upwind from the crater, and there is a hardy colony of native gannets and muttonbirds.There are no freshwater sources, although guides suggest that visitors dip their fingers in the few streams that trickle toward the shore and take a taste.Advertisement“You’re actually tasting dissolved rock,” Mr. Scott said. “The hydrothermal alteration on the island is decaying the rock and turning it into a solution. It has a very metallic taste to it.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It changed hands through a number of commercial mining operators until 1936, when it came into the possession of George Raymond Buttle, an Auckland stockbroker who apparently rather liked the idea of owning a volcano. He refused to sell it to the government, but, in 1952, agreed to have it declared a private nature reserve. Today, the island is still managed by the Buttle Family Trust.There are helicopter and small plane tours, and a local company, White Island Tours, has been running boat trips to the volcano since 1990. Peter and Jenny Tait, its owners, quit dairy farming to start fishing charters but found that many customers were more interested in the island.The operation still has a mom-and-pop feel: Boarding passes are small metal cones, cream strainers from the Taits’ farming days.Patrick O’Sullivan, the company’s marketing manager, said the passes were a good example of the company’s sustainability efforts, and make practical — if amusing — sense. “We found it works a lot better than a piece of paper, because of the distance between check-in and getting onto the boat,” he said. “I’ve never once had a passenger completely lose a pass and not be able to find it.”The company schedules daily trips but bad weather or uncooperative tides force cancellations about 70 days a year (most often in the winter months of May through September).It’s a bumpy ride heading to open water from the Whakatane River. The river mouth is narrow, caught between a steep bluff on one side and a rocky outcrop on the other, but widening it is out of the question.A sacred Maori burial ground lies on the northern bank, and interference is tapu, or forbidden. Ngati Awa, the local tribe, believes the spirits of the deceased travel from the burial ground to a large rock at the river mouth, where they shed their final tears before departing for the afterlife.Landing on White Island is not easy. Visitors have to clamber over the side of the tour boat into a dinghy and then, once it reaches the island, climb up a set of metal rungs on the side of an old wharf.AdvertisementA few years ago, the company tried to improve the landing arrangements using the 1930s-era wharf. “We added a shipping container to the end, 70 tons of concrete, anchored to the rocks underneath,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. Then, a cyclone hit. “Three days later, whoosh, we had 70 tons of concrete washed up on the beach.”There were various attempts to mine sulfur on White Island from the 1880s to the 1930s. The remains of a factory are scattered near the island’s shore, although most of the machinery has been corroded beyond recognition by decades of acidic erosion.The history is a side note for most visitors though, as they trek between bright yellow steam vents and bubbling mud pools.Linda Jameson from Cavan, Ireland, summed up what most people seemed to be thinking: “It’s like I’m on Mars!”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
