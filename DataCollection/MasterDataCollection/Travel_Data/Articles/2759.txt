It’s not unusual to view local art, consume regional foods or meet area trendsetters in boutique and luxury hotels. Now — to the great welcome of penny-pinching travelers — the trend in lodging to embody the location has trickled down to budget hotels and even brands generally regarded as cookie cutter.Graduate Hotels, recently opened in five college towns across the country and with another five opening in 2016 (rooms average $120 a night), tries to tell the story of its locations through design. Among them are the Graduate Madison in Madison, Wis., where the chandeliers are made from canoes and oars, and the Graduate Athens in Georgia, which hosts a music club that pays homage to the local music scene (groups including R.E.M. and Widespread Panic hail from Athens).Opened in December outside Aspen, Colo., the new Element Basalt-Aspen (rooms from $169), part of Starwood Hotels & Resorts’ extended-stay Element brand, serves locally roasted Bonfire Coffee, pours local beer and booze at its daily complimentary happy hour and hosts a branch of Basalt Bike & Ski for rentals or tuneups.Many large hotel companies are adding affordable, locally skewed brands to their portfolios, including AccorHotels, which acquired a 35 percent stake in the French boutique chain Mama Shelter and plans to open 20 new locations in the next five years, including London and New York. Mama Shelter Los Angeles (from $169) features Los Angeles-based film scripts in the rooms and a restaurant with a ceiling displaying chalk drawings by local artists.AdvertisementIn Denver, the new Hyatt Place and Hyatt House Denver/Downtown, combining a budget business hotel and an extended-stay option (from $149), recently opened with lobby décor that defies brand norms to include an art installation made of snowboards, another made of climbing ropes, and a third of wood harvested from trees killed by pine beetles. Several pairs of locally made Icelantic skis are on display, and interested guests are directed to buy them from a shop nearby.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
