Villas start at $1,995 a night, which includes meals and many activities.Guests at the new Six Senses Zil Pasyon in the Seychelles have exclusive access to three white sand beaches on Félicité Island. In addition to diving and snorkeling, the resort offers surfing, migratory bird-watching and island-hopping trips by boat. Its 30 villas, each with its own pool, start at $1,339 a night, which includes breakfast.About 150 miles northeast of Singapore, Bawah Private Island in Indonesia is scheduled to open in August (rates have yet to be determined).

Guests can choose between safari-style tents or over-water bungalows.Off northeastern Madagascar, the 14-villa Miavana just opened on Nosy Ankao.
