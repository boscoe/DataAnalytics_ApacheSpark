Jesus’s lips. “This is really the dead Christ,” Mr. Atkins said. “The color has fled from his lips.” You can also see how much blood he has lost — from the nails, the crown of thorns, the spear in his side. All this is intentional, he said, to show that Jesus has suffered immensely, but also to show that it has come to an end.
Jesus’s skin. This may be the most explicit message linking the rash-ridden patients at the monastery hospital and the suffering of Jesus. His skin shows snares, marks from whips, congealed blood. “All of this is meant to feel the pain that Christ underwent,” Mr. Atkins said. “It’s visualized by something that could be understood by the people of this hospital, their own experiences.”
The mourners. To Jesus’s right are Mary Magdalene on her knees, and an anguished Virgin Mary held by St. John the Evangelist. To his left is John the Baptist, next to a small lamb — a widely used symbol for Jesus’s sacrifice. If the altarpiece’s panels tell the story of Jesus, the agony of these characters is ironic, Mr. Atkins said. “They don’t know that resurrection will occur,” he said, “so they are responding accordingly. They are overwhelmed with grief.”
The seam. This is where the panel opens up. Note how Jesus’s body is not quite in the center, and the seam cuts through his body only at the right shoulder. Putting the seam in the middle of Jesus’s body would have been unthinkable, Mr. Atkins said, but its placement at the shoulder may be telling. One theory, he said, is that the seam subtly amputates the right arm, “which might have been one of the early treatments you could try to prevent the flow of the skin disease.”
The crown of thorns. The idea here is that “Christ has been past-tense ‘crucified,’ ” Mr. Atkins said. Characters nearby are still grieving in the aftermath of his death, not knowing that his resurrection is not far off. And the crown of thorns is removed from his body and rests at his feet: Jesus looks much better now that his sufferinghas passed. “He’s been cleaned up, and the blood has been washed away,” Mr. Atkins said. “You could make the comparison to the caregivers of the hospital.”
The arrow. The inclusion of St. Sebastian in the Isenheim Altarpiece is not clear and intuitive, Mr. Atkins said. Having images of saints and martyrs accompany panels was a common practice, though, he added. Here, he is shown with an arrow through his body; as the story goes, he was tied and shot with arrows, then left for dead. The angels in the background imply salvation from suffering.
The haunting demon. Here we see St. Anthony, the namesake of the monastery that originally housed the Isenheim Altarpiece. His name is also used for the shingles-like disease that the hospital treated, St. Anthony’s fire. He was known for enduring torment and torture, which is shown by the demon lurking over his shoulder, Mr. Atkins said. That the painting spoke so specifically to the hospital was notably innovative, he added.

Above, explore each numbered annotation to read more about some key and surprising features of the Isenheim Altarpiece, which the writer Francine Prose recently traveled to see.The Isenheim Altarpiece’s painted panels are at once gruesome and hopeful. Their message is bloody and full of pain — but also cathartic pathos, said Christopher Atkins, a curator of European painting and sculpture at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.“It’s really an ensemble of images that unfolds to reveal layers of meaning,” he said. “It’s a dynamic, powerful, moving work of art.”Sculpted by Niclaus of Haguenau and painted by Matthias Grünewald in the 1550s, the altarpiece was made for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which had a hospital that treated, among other ailments, the skin disease known as St. Anthony’s fire. (Today the altarpiece is on view at the Musée Unterlinden in France.)AdvertisementThe altarpiece, Mr. Atkins said, spoke to both the hospital’s often terminally ill patients and those who treated them. On the panels, Jesus’s Crucifixion is depicted as especially grisly. His skin is riddled with blemishes, and his fingers are grotesquely curled. On the ground, witnesses to his death are anguished.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And therein lies salvation. “The pain is temporary,” Mr. Atkins said. “There is release.”AdvertisementThat idea, told simply through recognizable, timeless images, is partly why the Isenheim Altarpiece’s importance and popularity have persisted for centuries, Mr. Atkins said. It might have been made for a hospital — the art world today might call it site-specific — but even out of place “it resonates, this idea of pain and torture that can be related to all sorts of times and contexts,” he said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
