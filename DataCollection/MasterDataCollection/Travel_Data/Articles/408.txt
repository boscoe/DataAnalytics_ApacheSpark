WilliamsThe low-key neighborhood of Shimokitazawa in western Tokyo is only one express-train stop from the sensory excesses of chaotic Shibuya — imagine Times Square, amplified — but it’s a world away in spirit. The area, locally called Shimokita, is populated by hip young Tokyoites drawn by the relaxed, small-town atmosphere that makes the neighborhood an anomaly in this bustling megalopolis. The narrow streets are easy to navigate and dense with local businesses, including a high concentration of vintage shops, unusual specialty stores and small boutiques stocked with wares from young artists and artisans. Many consider this the coolest neighborhood in Tokyo, and when you browse some of the most interesting shops, it’s hard to disagree.In a neighborhood overflowing with secondhand shops, this beautifully arranged vintage store stands out for its well-chosen collection of clothing, shoes and accessories, mainly from the 1950s to 1970s. Equally impressive is the enviable style of the employees, who dress the part in headscarves, floral midi-skirts and round granny glasses.2-26-19 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku; 81-050-3385-7975; smallchange.jp/ltthThose hoping to impress with a unique mode of transportation come to this bicycle shop, which specializes in hand-built custom beach cruisers in a rainbow of colors. Other two-wheeled options include matte-black lowrider bicycles and skater bikes, a skateboard-bicycle hybrid that looks like a scooter with pedals.2-35-15 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku; 81-03-3485-1180; shimochari.comThis homegrown clothing label extends its offbeat design sensibilities to the décor at its flagship store, where a recent artificial garden scene had dresses hung from branches of a leafy tree. On the spacious second floor, shelves are piled with T-shirts, sweatshirts, tote bags and denim printed with subversive bunny cartoons that are equal parts creepy and cute.3-30-2 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku; cune.jpThe indie version of a Japanese mall, this indoor shopping complex is in an enormous garage where over 20 stalls are rented by young designers and artisans. Colorful graffiti art at the entrance leads to a warren of shops stocked with everything from vintage clothing to hand-knit hats and cute koala stud earrings.2-25-8 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku; 81-03-3468-7000; k-toyo.jp/frame.htmlThe facade proclaims “Exciting Bookstore,” but this sprawling store is actually a manic pop-culture paradise with music radiating from every corner and aisles overflowing with manga, movies, music, toys, gadgets and more. It’s easy to get disoriented in the labyrinth, but bonsai-tree-growing kits and wasabi-flavored Kit Kats will reaffirm that you’re in Japan.2-10-15 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku; 81-03-3460-6135; village-v.co.jpAdvertisement
