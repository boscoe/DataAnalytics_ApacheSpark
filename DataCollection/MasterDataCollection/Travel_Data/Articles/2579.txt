The Bahamas resort Baha Mar has taken more than 10 years to open, but on Friday, the $4.2 billion, 1,000-acre development on a half-mile of beachfront in Nassau is expected to finally debut — at least, in part.Baha Mar comprises three hotel brands — Grand Hyatt, SLS Hotels and Rosewood Hotels & Resorts — for a total of 2,300 rooms. Grand Hyatt, with 1,800 rooms, is the largest and will be previewing on opening day; with nightly rates in the mid-$300 range, it’s also the most affordable. The 300-room SLS, with starting rates at upward of $500 a night, will debut later this year, and the 200-room Rosewood, the most upscale of the three with room prices from $700, is scheduled to open next spring (Grand Hyatt is open for invited guests initially and is accepting paid reservations for late May).But accommodations are only a component of Baha Mar: The project also includes a 100,000-square-foot casino — the largest in the Caribbean — that overlooks the ocean, according to Baha Mar’s president, Graeme Davis; 42 restaurants and lounges; 30 luxury retailers including Rolex and Bulgari; an 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course and Golf Club; 11 swimming pools surrounded by more than 250 palm trees; and a free-standing Espa brand spa with 24 treatment rooms (white marble plays a prominent role). The casino, the golf course, seven of the swimming pools, a part of the spa and a handful of retailers and restaurants will be open on April 21, while the rest of the amenities are scheduled to be introduced over the next year.Large-scale flashy resorts, in the vein of those in Macau and Las Vegas, may not be an anomaly today, but the drama leading up to Baha Mar’s opening sets it apart from the bunch: The Nassau-based development group BMD Holdings Ltd., led by the chief executive Sarkis Izmirlian, announced plans for the project, then a $1.6 billion venture, with much fanfare in late 2005.AdvertisementConstruction did not begin until early 2011 and was funded through a $2.45 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, along with an $850 million investment from Baha Mar and a $150 million investment from the contractor, China Construction America.AdvertisementA scheduled opening in May 2015 never happened. With the project more than 90 percent complete, Baha Mar declared bankruptcy, saying that China Construction America had repeatedly delayed the venture by missing construction deadlines. The construction company issued its own accusations of mismanagement, and a bitter fight ensued.Around 2,000 employees, most of them Bahamians who had been wooed to the resort with promises of bright futures, were out of jobs. Baha Mar was at a standstill.Its revival happened last November, when the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises signed an agreement to buy the resort from the Export-Import Bank of China for an undisclosed sum. Chow Tai Fook is involved in several businesses, including jewelry stores in Asia and casinos in Macau, and was already familiar with Baha Mar because it owns Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, a brand that was set to be one of the project’s hotel operators before the bankruptcy filing.The company is able to open Baha Mar so soon after agreeing to buy it, Mr. Davis said, because the Export-Import Bank had invested $700 million to finish building the resort over the last 18 months. “What we bought is a property that was nearly complete,” he said.For travel agents, the April 21 opening does not come without skepticism. Bobby Zur, who owns Travel Artistry, a consultancy in Franklin Lakes, N.J., and is on the hotel committee for the travel network Virtuoso, said that he was apprehensive about soft openings in general, particularly when it came to large-scale resorts, but that Baha Mar had added challenges for the long-term. “Creating a resort destination that has within it different levels of luxury and an appeal to disparate demographics can be done but isn’t always easy to accomplish,” he said.But Mr. Zur said he was optimistic about the resort because Rosewood was involved. “Rosewood is a brand that’s very protective of its guests and who it partners with, so I feel more confident that the project will come out of the gates faster and more smoothly than it would have otherwise,” he said.Dan Marmontello, the Caribbean product manager for CheapCaribbean.com, a site that sells affordable Caribbean and Mexico trips, will be staying at Baha Mar later this month as an invited guest. He said that he planned to sell the resort only if he thought that, after seeing it firsthand, it was ready to receive paying guests.Advertisement“It doesn’t matter that not everything is up and running,” he said, “but we need to make sure that there are enough amenities available so that our clients can go and have a good time there.”Baha Mar is one of the largest resorts to open in North America, according to Zachary Sears, a senior economist at Tourism Economics, which is part of the research firm Oxford Economics.The resort has 1,500 employees — many of whom had been laid off during the bankruptcy — but when all the hotels are open, the plan is to have 5,500. According to estimates from a 2013 report from Oxford Economics, Baha Mar could contribute around 12 percent to the gross domestic product of the Bahamas once the resort is complete and operating.Touches intended to be over the top are a trademark of mega resorts, and Baha Mar is no exception.Golfers, for example, can choose to rent one of more than 100 sets of top-of-the line clubs, including handmade Itobori clubs from Japan, which retail for $8,000, according to Sean Cracraft, the director of golf at the resort’s Royal Blue Golf Club.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

There is a studio where artists-in-residence will work and teach classes. “There’s not a lot of global awareness about Bahamian art or Caribbean art in general, but we’re hoping that the resort will be a platform to change that,” said John Cox, Baha Mar’s creative arts director.Delayed hotel openings are common, but Baha Mar’s trajectory is unusually long, said Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University who is familiar with the resort and its history. “There’s been a lot of buzz about this project and drama surrounding it for years,” she said. “ It’s an ambitious venture, and all eyes will be on it to see how it fares.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
