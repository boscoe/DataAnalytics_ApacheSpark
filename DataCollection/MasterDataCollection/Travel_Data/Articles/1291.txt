The travel website TripAdvisor has apologized to a Texas woman for repeatedly deleting her review of a Mexican resort that detailed how she had been raped there by a security guard.TripAdvisor issued the apology to the woman, Kristie Love, 35, after The Journal Sentinel of Milwaukee published an investigation on Wednesday about her 2010 episode and accounts by other travelers who said the website also removed their warnings about assaults and rapes at hotels.The Journal Sentinel found that two other women reported that they had been sexually assaulted at the same Mexican resort in recent years.“We are horrified that this victim experienced this assault on her vacation in Mexico, and other travelers should be aware of this incident,” TripAdvisor said in a statement on its website on Wednesday.AdvertisementIt said that it had restored Ms. Love’s original comment about what happened to her at the hotel, the Iberostar Paraiso near Playa del Carmen and Cancún in Mexico, and emphasized that it valued posts that warned of assaults, robberies and thefts. Her comment was restored in its original chronological position, now buried behind thousands of pages of other posts.AdvertisementThe company said her post was deleted in 2010 because its previous comment guidelines required that “all language needed to be G-rated.” Since that policy changed “a few years ago,” reviews mentioning rapes and assaults have remained on the site, the company said.“We believe any firsthand experience should be posted to our site as a means to communicate to other consumers looking for information on where they should travel,” TripAdvisor said.What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The company said workers at the Iberostar Paraiso told Ms. Love to file a report with the police but she refused.“Just as it would in the United States, the failure to have an official complaint on file with the authorities hampers the ability to investigate a claim,” the company said in a statement.Ms. Love, who could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening, told The Journal Sentinel that the hotel staff members refused to help her after she reported the rape to them. After she returned to Dallas, the hotel told her it had no report of her episode, stopped returning her phone calls and threatened to sue her, she said.A few weeks after the attack, she returned to Mexico and filed a police report but the hotel would not cooperate with the authorities, she told The Journal Sentinel.TripAdvisor wields significant influence in the travel industry, and its reviews for hotels and restaurants typically rank near the top in online search listings. Because of its power and popularity, businesses covet positive reviews from travelers and fret about negative comments.AdvertisementIn its statement, TripAdvisor said that since its founding in 2000, it had enforced a strict separation between its reviews and commerce initiatives. Its business listings allow travelers to read reviews and book reservations on the same page.But the investigation by The Journal Sentinel found other instances in which negative reviews, including comments that warned about assaults and deaths, had been deleted without explanation.It said its reporting began in July after the death of a 20-year-old Wisconsin college student at a resort in Mexico who was found unconscious after drinking what her family believed was contaminated alcohol.TripAdvisor said it was also introducing a notification “badge” on its business listings to warn travelers if there had been “health and safety or discrimination issues” reported at the business.Sandra Garcia contributed reporting and Doris Burke contributed research.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
