I grew up in St. Louis — a city built in the shadow of Cahokia, the Native American “Manhattan” of early America. Every St. Louis kid took at least one field trip to the site, a collection of over 70 mounds and earthworks. Yet, somehow I missed this initiation into original Midwest culture. I took my kids, Jack & Annie, on a beautiful afternoon to see this marvel. Even though it’s the largest prehistoric earthwork in America, somehow it can be forgotten — even by a loyal St. Louisan. It was time to make sure my kids didn’t miss it too.As we climbed the smaller mounds, my kids and I tried to imagine how long it would have taken to carry baskets of dirt across the long open fields. It is estimated that the 10-story Monks Mound is filled with 50 million cubic feet of hand-moved dirt. When we finally got to the stairs* to the big one, it was much higher than it looked — and we noted the danger the chieftains undertook by living on that lofty ground.* We were the only tourists at the top — except for a few people exercising. The locals have grown so accustomed to the mound they use it as a stairclimber.On the top of Monks MoundYou can see the Gateway Arch in the distance, from the top of Monks Mound.
