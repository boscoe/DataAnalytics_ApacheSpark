In the United States, the guide features such free finds as the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., and outdoor organ concerts in San Diego.Cities covered reflect popular tourist destinations, with a bias toward places considered less affordable.“We thought covering expensive cities was probably more of value,” said Jessica Cole, the editor of the book. “There are fewer in Africa because there are many affordable cities there compared to Dubai or London.”Lists throughout the book highlight affordable safaris in Africa, cheap but high-end food in Asia and free spectator sports in the United States, like pond hockey in Minneapolis.Advertisement
