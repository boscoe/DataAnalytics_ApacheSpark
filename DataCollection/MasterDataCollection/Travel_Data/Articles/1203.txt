For our 52 Places to Go feature in January, we asked some of our photographers to shoot photo essays for the destinations they were covering. This is our second, on Abu Dhabi — No. 8 on the list. Photos and text by Andy Haslam.This once impoverished fishing village, guarded by a number of small forts, was transformed with the discovery of oil in the late 1950s — and is now often described as the world’s richest city.Many of the top architectural practices from around the world have been commissioned to fulfill the vision of a futuristic metropolis. The latest gateway to this oasis, once a simple river crossing, is now the Zaha Hadid-designed Sheikh Zayed Bridge. Its sinuous, dunelike form provides a major link to the heart of the city. The Umm Al Nar Power and Desalination Plant provides all the country’s fresh water and power. Looking the other way, you can see the old bridges and the original fort that protected the crossing. It is obvious this is still a land in a state of flux and rapid expansion. Many projects are under construction with grand structures in some cases leading to nowhere, like the Al Bateen Bridge — a beautiful bridge without, as yet, a destination.Advertisement
