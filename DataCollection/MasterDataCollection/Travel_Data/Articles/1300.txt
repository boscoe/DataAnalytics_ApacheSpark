(Each says it has one runway open.) Baltimore-Washington International, which had very limited service on Sunday, is seeing fewer cancellations than any day since the storm’s arrival.The three major airports with service to New York City — La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark — which had been offering limited service on Sunday, are also experiencing fewer cancellations.
