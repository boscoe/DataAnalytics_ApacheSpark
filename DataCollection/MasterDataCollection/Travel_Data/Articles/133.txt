Travel warnings about the Zika virus, especially for pregnant women, are very much in the news now, but the germ was discovered more than a half century ago, and you may have already visited places where it flourishes.As of December 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported evidence of transmission of the virus in at least 45 countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific islands. There were cases reported in Mexico and El Salvador in November 2015, and one in Puerto Rico in December. Travelers should be concerned, but there is no need for panic.“There are two things that make people pay attention,” said one expert, Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease doctor and scientist at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto. “It showed up where it has never been before, and it is rapidly spreading. That’s because Aedes mosquitoes are widespread throughout most of Latin America and parts of the U.S.”Mosquitoes of the Aedes species (the name derives from a Greek word for “unpleasant”) seem to be the main vector. These mosquitoes also spread dengue and chikungunya, two other, more severe, viral infections.AdvertisementThe virus was isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda. Researchers were studying the transmission of yellow fever, when they found the new virus in a rhesus monkey. Its first appearance in humans was in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, and the first large outbreak of disease was in 2007 on Yap Island in Micronesia.AdvertisementThere was an even larger outbreak in French Polynesia in October 2013, when about 10,000 cases were reported. In 2014, there were cases in New Caledonia and the Cook Islands in the South Pacific.For most people, the Zika infection is not particularly serious. According to the C.D.C., only about 20 percent of infected people have any symptoms at all, and the few who become sick usually have a mild fever, sometimes diarrhea or a rash, headache or muscle pain. The illness goes away within a week, and rarely requires hospitalization. Rest, pain medication and hydration are the only treatments, and there is no cure or vaccine. There has never been a death attributed to the Zika virus, according to the C.D.C.Still, there are significant dangers for pregnant women because the virus has been linked to congenital microcephaly, a serious and often fatal birth defect in which the fetal brain fails to develop properly.
                Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.            The large outbreak in Brazil, which began in May 2015, is particularly worrisome because the number of cases of congenital microcephaly in newborns and stillborns has abruptly increased. It is possible that there is some other reason for this, but there is general agreement that until another association is found, the Zika virus should be assumed to be the cause.No one knows how many people in Brazil are infected, but C.D.C. estimates range from 500,000 to 1.5 million. There have been about 3,500 cases of congenital microcephaly, according to Brazilian health authorities. On Jan. 15, the Hawaii State Health Department reported that a microcephalic baby infected with the virus had been born in Oahu, the first such case in the United States. The mother had lived in Brazil during part of her pregnancy.Knowledge is evolving, but the C.D.C . has issued Alert Level 2 Warnings (“Increased risk in defined settings or associated with specific risk factors”) for Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Puerto Rico. The agency did not mention Africa or Asia in connection with the Zika virus, but warnings about the dangers of other mosquito-borne illnesses are already in effect in those regions.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For the moment, travelers to any area where the virus has been reported should cover exposed skin with long-sleeved shirts and long pants, use insect repellent like DEET and use permethrin-treated clothing and equipment.“There are Aedes in parts of southern Europe — Portugal, France, Spain, Italy,” Dr. Khan said, “so when we look ahead to the summer, the epidemic may look very different and it’s possible that people could introduce it into parts of Europe. But that’s looking a couple of steps ahead.”AdvertisementPregnant women, in no matter which trimester, should talk to their doctors if they must travel to countries where Zika infections have been found, and if the trip is not essential, they should consider postponing it. Women who are trying to become pregnant are also at risk, and should discuss their travel plans and the risks of the Zika infection with their health care providers. All travelers should strictly follow the routines that will prevent mosquito bites.Aedes mosquitoes flourish seasonally in large areas in the United States, and year-round in most of Florida and parts of Texas and California, so travelers who are infected abroad and return to these areas could spread the illness.Sexual transmission of the virus may also be possible. In 2011, researchers found that a scientist who had contracted the Zika virus while working in Senegal transmitted it to his wife after his return home to Colorado, almost certainly through sexual intercourse. And in 2015 the virus was found in the sperm of a 44-year-old man in Tahiti. There is also at least a theoretical risk of transmission through blood transfusions.Most infected people will not know they are infected, but Dr. Khan said that those who return with symptoms of Zika within two weeks of leaving a place where the virus is active should take precautions. They should let their health care provider know so that doctors and the public health system can respond properly, and, if they are returning to areas where Aedes mosquitoes are present, they should assiduously avoid being bitten by covering their skin and using insect repellent.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
