AdvertisementSupported byBy Justin SablichThe fear of awkward dinner conversations doesn’t appear to be strong enough to keep folks from visiting their loved ones this Thanksgiving.In fact, AAA estimates that 50.9 million people will travel 50 miles or more this Thanksgiving season (Wednesday, Nov. 22 to Sunday, Nov. 26), up 3.3 percent from last year.While alternative modes of transportation (train, bus or boat) are collectively expected to climb about 1.1 percent, or about 1.48 million people, car and air travel remain the two most popular forms of transportation this Thanksgiving season. Here’s what you need to know to avoid the crowds and have as painless a trip as possible via this nation’s roads and airports this Thanksgiving.AAA said that 89 percent of all travelers this season will be driving, and these folks are likely to pay more for gas and rental cars.Nationwide, gas will cost about 40 cents more per gallon compared to 2015, according to GasBuddy.com, a website that tracks fuel prices. The daily rental car rate is at a five-year high, $70 per day, according to AAA.While these factors are not under any one traveler’s control, when to depart and return can be, and knowing the best times and days to do so can at least save you some road rage.Based on data from 2016’s Thanksgiving travel season, Google can estimate which are the best and worst times and days to be on the road this week. While exact times and days vary by city (nine of which are detailed below), some general rules of thumb exist for most major cities as far as when to leave.Unless you’re an early riser and can get on the road between 3 and 4 a.m. (local time), you’re better off waiting until Thanksgiving morning and leaving around 6 a.m. The heaviest traffic tends to be between 3 and 4 p.m.The best days and times vary more when it comes to returning home, but mid-to-late afternoon on both Saturday and Sunday are times to avoid.You may see even bigger crowds at the airport this year, as air travel is expected to be up by five percent, or 3.95 million, for the Thanksgiving travel season, according to AAA.Airfarewatchdog.com’s annual holiday travel poll (which also includes the December holidays) showed that air travel as a whole this holiday season will be the biggest it has been since 2013, with 46 percent of respondents stating that they plan to fly, up 53 percent from 2016.“It looks like a significant number of travelers plan to trade their wheels for wings this year,” George Hobica, the president of Airfarewatchdog.com, said in an email. “Perhaps recent pricing competition amongst legacy and discount carriers alike have people feeling that holiday airfares are attainable, even if they’re pricier — which they are.”Whatever the reason, travelers should know what to expect when they get to the airport this year, and how best to avoid long waits at check-in and security.New this year is the Clear biometric screening program, which is currently available in 18 major cities and 24 airports. Clear members go through a dedicated Clear lane to a pod where they either scan their fingerprints or look at a camera that can read iris images. You can’t completely bypass T.S.A. security, but you’re bumped to the front of the screening line.Learn all about the program here. Otherwise, the T.S.A. recommends common-sense preparedness, like knowing which items are allowed past security, and to arrive earlier than normal, if you want to shorten your wait.Other factors depend on the airport you’re in and when you’re in it. To help with that, Hopper was able to determine the 25 busiest U.S. airports for the Thanksgiving holiday season and which times the lines at check-in and security are expected to be the longest. This is based in its own itinerary data from this year. We highlighted nine below, and more can be found at Hopper.com.
