Five years ago, the New York-based photographer Robert Presutti spent two weeks in a remote area of the Sierra Nevadas shooting Arhuaco life in Colombia. The trip stayed with him long after he returned home.I had never been to Colombia before. I flew to Bogotá and to Santa Marta, and then traveled by Jeep and by foot. When I got there, I literally was there for two days and was told: “Don’t do anything. Don’t talk. They are having a meeting — like a town meeting — to decide whether you have the right to photograph them. They’re going to look at you, your behavior, the way you interact with them.” They said O.K.At the beginning, they were like, “There is this white boy, what does he want?” But after a while, they stopped paying attention to me. People somehow sensed my honesty. It allowed me to become very intimate with them. I took pictures with them when they were sleeping, when they were cooking. I just was there with them.Coming back to New York, everything I saw bothered me. Our behavior toward things, the waste — it took me a while to get readjusted.
