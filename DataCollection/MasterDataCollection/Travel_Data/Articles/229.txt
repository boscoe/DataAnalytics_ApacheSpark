Lonely Planet, the travel guidebook publisher, has just released “The Best Things in Life Are Free,” a hardcover book ($22.99) detailing free and bargain attractions and experiences in more than 60 cities and destinations worldwide.Each article features six to 18 recommendations, including cherry blossoms, inexpensive hot springs and a professional sumo wrestling practice free to viewers in Tokyo; free museum days in Oslo; snorkeling beaches in Sydney; a bargain graffiti tour in Bogotá, Colombia; and low-priced happy hour spots in Venice. In the United States, the guide features such free finds as the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., and outdoor organ concerts in San Diego.Cities covered reflect popular tourist destinations, with a bias toward places considered less affordable.“We thought covering expensive cities was probably more of value,” said Jessica Cole, the editor of the book. “There are fewer in Africa because there are many affordable cities there compared to Dubai or London.”Lists throughout the book highlight affordable safaris in Africa, cheap but high-end food in Asia and free spectator sports in the United States, like pond hockey in Minneapolis.A version of this article appears in print on August 14, 2016, on Page TR2 of the New York edition with the headline: An Adage Proves True.
