At 612 rooms, it’s also the largest and will serve as the brand’s flagship. When the first Moxy opened in Milan in 2014, it seemed to resonate with travelers who were attracted to the sleek design, friendly but unobtrusive service, vibrant restaurants and bars and affordable rooms.“That first Moxy was an instant hit because it combined everything that many travelers, and especially millennials, are looking for in a hotel, including buzzy public spaces and a sweet price point,” said Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. “All of the Moxy’s since then have been successful for these same reasons.”Lightstone’s president, Mitchell Hochberg, said he agrees with Ms. McCarthy’s take on the wants of modern travelers. “They don’t care about the size of their hotel rooms because they don’t want to be in their rooms other than to sleep,” he said. “They also don’t care about someone carrying their bags for them and mints on their pillow.”To his point, with a starting size of 150 square feet, the property’s guest rooms are intentionally cozy, but they’re not without upscale touches such as 300-thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, 43-inch HD televisions and oversized rain showers. To maximize space, they have foldable tables and chairs that can be hung up on wall pegs around the room. The interior design firm Yabu Pushelberg made the furniture for the bedrooms.A night’s stay begins at $139, a bargain by New York City standards but far pricier than the between 30 and 40 cents the building’s first hotel guests paid in the early 20th century.Room service isn’t available, but, then again, staying at a Moxy isn’t about being in your hotel room. Guests are encouraged to spend their time in the property’s lively communal areas.In the Times Square Moxy, these public areas have polished concrete floors, exposed concrete columns, distressed brick walls, open ceilings, a lobby with plenty of leather couches to sink into (also designed by Yabu Pushelberg) and Instagram-worthy art installations.The Japanese artist Sawada, for example, is behind the 14-foot-all glass and mirror bear hanging from the atrium at the main entrance.And then there are the five restaurants and bars run by Tao Group, a company behind popular restaurants and night life spots including the Marquee nightclubs in New York City and Las Vegas.The interior design firm Rockwell Group designed three of the spaces, including a seafood restaurant, Legasea; an egg-centric sandwich shop, Egghead; and a sprawling indoor/outdoor rooftop bar, Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge.The rooftop venue, open year-round, has views of the Empire State Building, a 28-seat rotating carousel and a menu item created to raise eyebrows: patrons can pay $99 to hang their hats in one of the 19 rooms called crash pads, 120-square-foot accommodations fitted with twin beds and televisions.“They’re meant for customers who order one too many drinks or don’t want the night to end,” said Noah Tepperberg, a partner at Tao Group. “As in with our other venues, we want to push the envelope.”But, unlike his other restaurants and bars, which are known for their velvet ropes and high prices, Mr. Tepperberg said that the ones at Moxy Times Square will be both more accessible to everyone and less expensive.The public, too, was welcome to dine at the marble-column restaurant at the New Mills Hotel, which could seat more than 400 people at a time and served meals for as little as 5 cents. That property may have seen its last days in 1954, but the ethos of the new Moxy Times Square, in some ways, is a throwback to that time.Advertisement
