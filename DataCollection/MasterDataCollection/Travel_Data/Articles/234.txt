Nov. 13 marks one year since the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left 130 people dead.Tourism has suffered after the attacks — hotel occupancy in Paris this year through September was down 11 percent, compared with the same period in 2015, according to data from MKG Group, a hospitality industry research company that tracks the occupancy of 480 Paris hotels. That is the equivalent of 44,000 rooms and around 53 percent of the city’s hotel market.Statistics, however, don’t tell the stories of the travel-related businesses in Paris that have been affected by the attacks.Four people who oversee such businesses spoke as the anniversary approached. Though their roles are different, they have similar perspectives: last-minute bookings are on the rise; lowering prices to attract more travelers isn’t the solution; and the second half of 2016, for the most part, seems more promising than the first.Here, a budget hotel owner, tour company owner, luxury hotel general manager, and restaurateur share their stories:SERGE TRIGANO, a co-founder of Mama Shelter, a Paris-based hotel brand,with a 172-room Philippe Starck-designed property in the 20th Arrondissement where nightly rates begin at 79 euros, about $88.AdvertisementThe attacks hurt us right away — our usual occupancy rates were 80 to 82 percent, but in December and January, they were 60 percent. We bounced back slightly in the spring, but as of October, our average occupancy for the year is 72 percent. The biggest change is that we have fewer leisure travelers than before — our weekdays are busy with business travelers, but our weekends, which used to be 100 percent full, are only 70 percent full. Also, these leisure travelers now book six weeks in advance instead of six months. Our all-day restaurant is faring better. After last November, we went from serving 800 meals to 400 meals a day, but now, we’re back up to where we were. It’s never occurred to me to lower room prices because they’re already low. I’m hopeful that, eventually, like the restaurant, occupancy comes back.AdvertisementEDWIGE CHEVALLIER, the general manager and owner of W Travel France, a Paris-based company selling half- to multiday tours of Paris.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And, instead of booking six months in advance, clients, most of whom are from the United States, will book a few weeks or even just a few days in advance. The unpredictability of whether I will get bookings or not is stressful, but I hope that by next summer, people won’t be afraid to come to Paris anymore.LAURENT GARDINIER, the co-owner of Les 110 de Taillevent Paris, a wine bar, and Taillevent, a 70-year-old restaurant with two Michelin stars; both are in the Eighth ArrondissementParis has always attracted tourists, but since Nov. 13, it feels like the city has been forgotten. I see this at Taillevent — 70 percent of our dinner crowd used to be tourists, mainly Americans and Japanese, but right after the attacks, they stopped coming, and earlier this year, business was down 20 to 30 percent. Though the average dinner costs between 250 and 300 euros a person, I don’t think price is an issue for these diners — it’s fear that’s keeping them from Paris. At Les 110, where a meal is around 85 euros a person, we haven’t been hurt because the diners are mostly Parisian. But, the situation may be improving because the reservations at Taillevent for September and October are almost as high as they were last year.JOSE SILVA, the general manager of Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris, a 244-room hotel in the Eighth Arrondissement where nightly rates begin at 1,000 euros.The streets of Paris were empty after Nov. 13, and that emptiness spilled over to our hotel as well. Our year-round occupancy is 80 percent, but we will end up this year at 50 percent. Many of our guests are repeat customers, and they are the ones staying with us, but we don’t see as many of those first-time travelers to Paris. Maybe they’re afraid to come? Though we didn’t reduce room rates in this last year, we did offer more packages to help draw in business, such as three nights for the price of two. Thankfully, September and October have been much brighter with occupancy rates at 82 percent. After a tough start to 2016, we seem to be at normal cruising speed.An article on Nov. 13 about the Paris terrorist attacks misidentified the administrative district in which the restaurant Taillevent and the wine bar Les 110 de Taillevent Paris are located. They are in the Eighth Arrondissement, not the Ninth.A version of this article appears in print on November 13, 2016, on Page TR2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Year After Paris Attacks, Challenges for Tourism.
