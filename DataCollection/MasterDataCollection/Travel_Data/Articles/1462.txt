Florence may be known for its current designer offerings — from the likes of Ferragamo, Gucci and Marni — but savvy shoppers have also discovered that the city is full of exceptional vintage finds, from antiques, furniture and clothing to retro treasures. In fact, in the last few years the city has welcomed a number of new secondhand shops that have only added to the richness of an already considerable vintage shopping scene.Opened in late 2013, this shop close to Santa Maria Novella is a favorite for Florentine interior designers, with antique steamer trunks (from €400), horticultural prints, French porcelain tea sets (from €200) and gilded frames among the items for sale. A trademark is the unusual maps — created with sheet music and coffee stains marking out the countries — that have become quite trendy (from €1,000).Via del Sole, 11; 39-055-265-7635; bottegadicorte.comWhen this tiny shop opened in 2014 on a quiet corner behind the Arno River, it started offering a small but extremely well-curated collection of vintage and new designs, a selection that one might find in the closet of a well-heeled Florentine, with vintage shoes, purses and dresses, from designers such as Bulgari, Valentino and Louis Vuitton. Recent finds included a vintage Bakelite belt from the 1960s (€45) and a python pochette from Prada (€295).Piazetta dei Del Bene, 6/5; 39-055-280-906; marieantoinettefirenze.comLovers of vintage jewelry make a beeline to this shop near the Ponte Vecchio where handmade Art Deco-style pieces include a showstopping topaz necklace (€180 euros) and other one-of-a-kind statement jewelry.
