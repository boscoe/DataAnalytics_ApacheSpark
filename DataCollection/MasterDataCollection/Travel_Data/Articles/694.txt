Built in the 19th century, the Westergasfabriek hasn’t produced gas in decades, but its handsome red brick buildings have been repurposed to house creative projects ranging from an art house cinema to a trendsetting nightclub. Spruced-up outdoor areas host regular flea and food markets, and new bars, restaurants and shops now attract Amsterdammers from across the city. Meanwhile, the surrounding urban park beckons with its large grassy meadows, petting zoo and benches that double as art installations.This multifunctional pop-up — it’s open until Sept. 30 — has brought new life to a gabled brick building. Inside, the project shows art in a tiny gallery, pours aperitifs in its bar, and serves seasonal meals (and a cocktail-and-coffee liquid lunch) in its restaurant, which has become a locals’ favorite on weekends with ample seating on the sun-soaked terrace.Haarlemmerweg 8a; 31-20-303-8893; gustafson.amsterdamHeaping skillets of mussels are paired with aromatic gin and tonics at this two-year-old restaurant focused on local fare, from Dutch oysters to the small-batch V2C Gin.
