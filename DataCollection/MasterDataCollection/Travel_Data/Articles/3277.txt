CreditSusan Wright for The New York Times        Something was lacking on the Tuscan coast.The Tyrrhenian Sea spilled out as always between the outstretched arms of Porto Ercole to the south and Talamone to the north. Sailboats crossed before the hazy, distant islands. Inland, the landscape hit all the familiar “Under the Tuscan Sun” touchstones: cypress trees pointing up at billowing cumulus clouds, vineyards rolling back to medieval hilltop towns.And yet, as I stood this December outside the house where my wife’s parents have spent their summers for years, something was missing. The answer came from my daughter, who ran up the hill like a screwy Italo-English-speaking town crier.“There are no zanzare,” she shouted gleefully. No mosquitoes!The area of Maremma on the coast of Tuscany and Latium was long called Bitter Maremma and plagued by malaria until the 1950s. Those diseased days are long gone, but the mosquitoes are still a nuisance, and the smell of bug spray mixed with sunscreen is the perfume of summer.But in December, wafts of wood burning in chimneys or bonfires in the fields take over and the mosquitoes mostly vanish. Their disappearance is just one example of how absence — of crowds, cars and commotion — makes my heart grow fonder for the Tuscan off-season.Years ago, my wife’s family, who live in Rome, began summering along the Argentario coast. Her father kept his sailboat docked in Talamone, the port town where, in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi stopped for reinforcements in his effort to unite Italy. Like other summering Romans, my wife and her family sailed to nearby islands and swam in the open water.AdvertisementI entered the picture more than a decade ago, bringing with me extreme bouts of seasickness on attempted maritime excursions (I’m talking “Mayday, Mayday” seasickness) and a swimming stroke that resembles a drowning man’s last throes. And yet, I have found much here to love during summer vacations: sandy beaches, swimming holes overlooked by fortresses, the glamorous Il Pellicano hotel, where my wife and I found ourselves sipping wine with celebrity bands (R.E.M.) and famous chefs (Mario Batali). Maremma’s nature preserve, rife with hiking trails, birdsong and wildlife, made for purifying afternoons.AdvertisementThat’s Maremma in the summer. Winter is another tale. A dozen years ago, when I lived in Rome and made the first of many warm-weather visits to the area, the thought of visiting when temperatures dip into the 30s, tourism freezes and beach clubs close never occurred to me. Now I can’t get it out of my mind.On my recent visit, I arrived by train at night to join my wife and children, aged 3 and 6, who had gone ahead of me. I pushed my suitcase up the hill to my in-laws’ house in a wheelbarrow. (Don’t knock it till you try it!) In the crisp air, the constellations I’m unable to recognize sparkled with mocking clarity. The moon illuminated the earthen rows of the now barren vegetable garden and threw shadows of the umbrella pine trees onto the sloping lawn like spilled ink. In the house, my wife had warmed our bedroom with a rotating heater, which, when we mistook it for a fan one August evening, had nearly melted us. I made a last obsessive check for mosquitoes lying in wait on the walls, saw only the stains of battles past (and a shoe print) and then dozed off to droneless sleep.ITALYScansano Areaof detailPeretaRomeMaremmaMaglianoin ToscanaMancianoFonteblandaGROSSETOTalamoneTUSCANYOrbetelloITALYPorto ErcoleTyrrhenian Sea5 milesFEB. 3, 2016
The chilly Maremma morning greeted us like an animated postcard: the grandfather in the yard, the grandmother serving panettone for breakfast, the daughter on the swing that hangs from an olive tree, and the boy swinging a stick as he called out the names of Mets World Series stars who are no longer Mets. (Miss you, Murphy.)All of it was adorable, but none of it was coffee. To the bewilderment of my in-laws, I make a point in Italy of drinking espressos only while standing up at coffee bars. I’ve grown fond of the local bar and the rest of Fonteblanda, the no-streetlight hamlet at the foot of the hill. The barber and rumored heartthrob of local widows cuts my son’s hair next to the butcher shop that feeds my addiction to wild boar and the local Podere 414 Morellino di Scansano red wine. I make daily visits to the pasta shop, Vi.Ba, where I think they might one day name a pasta shape in my honor (l’Americano rotondo).Here and across the Grosseto province in the southern reaches of Maremma, these small communities play quieter notes that resonate more deeply in winter.That is not to say the season is without its flourishes. In Orbetello, an ancient Etruscan town on the coast where I was married by a former neo-Fascist government minister who went on to be investigated for corruption, we watched a flamboyance of flamingos wading in the lagoon. The wetlands of Maremma attract more winter fowl — spoonbills, lapwings, snipes — than any other place in Tuscany; even without binoculars we could see the flamingos land on the still water.We continued on to a local riding stable. Against the backdrop of hills tumbling with fog, my 6-year-old daughter took her first horseback riding lesson from an instructor who wore socks branded “dressage.” She dismounted and I decided the time had come to do something for myself. We drove farther down the road to La Antica Fattoria La Parrina farm, where I sampled their bright Muraccio red wine and insanely rich Gorgonzola Guttus. Then I washed it down with more Muraccio. Maybe this is the wine talking, but Maremma winters make for perfect napping weather.AdvertisementOn other days we visited Pereta, the pearl of the Maremma hilltop towns, built up by the Aldobrandeschi family nearly 1,000 years ago. The children raced up to the 13th-century tower, the tallest in Maremma, while we looked over the ledge at our favorite view in all of Italy. Below us a balcony of manicured grass and orange trees surrounding stone steps and parapets overlooked an undulating countryside peppered with swallows swooping over the browning woods. Another of Pereta’s destinations is Da Maria Moretti, a restaurant that can be hard to get into in the summer. Not now. An empty restaurant is usually awkward and sad. Not this one. With the lighted fireplace, the warmth of Luciano, the owner and cook, the crostini flavored with artichokes, and fresh pasta flavored with truffles and wild boar, we felt as if we were in our own (though much better-catered) living room. The kids ran around accordingly.During our stay, we drove the switchback roads to Scansano and to Manciano, called the Spy of Maremma for its 360-degree view of the countryside, where we ate more mushrooms and pasta and crostini at Trattoria da Paolino. In the winter, we prefer dining out for lunch instead of dinner because the evenings come quicker and the roads get dark.On most nights, after a dinner of fresh pasta at home, we caught up on reading or the latest Vatican scandal on television. (The allegedly corrupt priest, I learned, wanted to see his suspected accomplice wearing a “baby-doll” negligee.) But one evening we got into the holiday spirit by taking in a performance of madrigals in the town of Magliano in Toscana. That night, in San Martino, a tiny church warmed by a space heater, the audience in the pews matched the number of chorus members dressed in tuxedos and gowns on stage who sang “I’m a-dreaming of a white-a Christ-a-mas” and more local carols in their native tongue. Afterward the singers posed for pictures in front of walls with centuries-old and peeling frescoes. They invited us out for prosecco. But we went home to eat wild boar.A word on wild boar. After a decade of visits to Maremma, during which time I put wild boar on fresh tortelli, papardelle or tagliatelle, often after an appetizer of wild boar prosciutto and before a wild boar steak, I thought this might be time to see the animal in its pre-carne incarnation.The wild boar, or cinghiale, competes with the long-horned Maremmana cattle for status as the area’s signature animal. Unlike the grazing cows, the boars are menaces, destroying crops, scaring children and offending the eyes with their long snouts, muddy black hair and sharp, curved tusks. It is our duty to eat them, and as much of them as possible. That, at least, was the view of the hunters my father-in-law and I met up with one afternoon.The legal season for hunting boar starts in November and ends in January. When the weather chills, the hunters grab their shotguns and head into the woods or onto the estates of wealthy landowners, who lease out their property for hunting. Teams of at least 20 hunters release special Segugio Maremmano hounds to flush out the boars. Some hunters follow on foot through valleys of high grass and brush, while others stand on platforms in assigned posts waiting with their guns lowered for a boar to pass. As men in camouflage, one in an orange vest that read “Attention, Wild Boar Hunter at Work,” yelped to their pets and each other, the smell of gunpowder, garlic and dandelions scented the air.At the end of the day they had killed 13 boars, and drove them in pickup trucks to a large shed. While the older hunters drank cherry-flavored wine on a long table amid trophies and calendars featuring nudes (not the Botticelli variety), the young men butchered the boars. The hunters who made the kill shots got the severed heads, because they made a sauce so flavorful, one explained, that it “drives you nuts.”We got back home and my son, who had spent the day with his grandmother and sister feeding carrots to white horses and hiking fields that bloom with asparagus in the spring, was zonked. I picked him up and we looked down at Talamone. He dozed off on my shoulder, and the town, unlit and quiet, also seemed at rest before another summer on the sea.AdvertisementThe next morning we stopped by the nearly empty port to say hello to my father-in-law, who was doing some work on his boat. We walked around the town’s high stone wall to Bagno delle Donne, my favorite swimming hole in Italy. In the summer, the paved ground next to the small cliff that the kids dive off is packed with beach chairs, sunbathers and the pulsing radio from the busy aperitivo bar. All that had evaporated. We walked over holes in the concrete for umbrella sticks and passed a row of locked cabanas. Facing the sea, my wife told the children to close their eyes and say what they heard.“Acqua,” “Bubbles,” “Footsteps di papà.”It was true! I was creeping up behind them with the iPhone camera because (A) I’ve become that kind of dad, and (B) in winter these moments of kids in overcoats retrieving shells or dipping their fingers in the gurgling water take on a romantic, windswept and irresistibly photogenic quality. As if we’re the ghosts haunting the place.On Christmas Eve, with the children back in Rome with their grandparents, my wife and I took a last drive toward Talamone, on a gently curving road that James Bond raced over in “Casino Royale.” We took it slower.On the side of the road sat a recently rediscovered Roman cistern. Surrounded by olive trees and clover, local volunteers and archaeologists had cut the brick ruin out of a dense overgrowth. As we walked the perimeter, smelling damp mushrooms and peering into the ancient windows, we marveled that the cistern had been there, hidden and unnoticed, through hundreds of trips back and forth on that road.It was, like Maremma in the off-season, there all along. We just needed to stop and notice it.A jewel within a jewel, Trattoria da Maria Moretti  (Via Roma, 10, Pereta; da-maria-moretti.com) oozes warmth, whether from the hospitality of its owners, the heat from the fire or the steam rising from the abundant plates of fresh pasta. Get the crostini (above, with truffles and tomato), then move on to the tortelli with ragù, gnocchi with mushrooms and tagliatelle with truffles. Lunch for two, about 65 euros, or about $70 at $1.05 to the euro.A small, cozy dining room off the town’s main drag, Trattoria da Paolino (Via Marsala, 41, Manciano; trattoriadapaolino.it/home) serves wonderful ricotta and spinach gnudi in a truffled preparation, and trofie with artichokes and sausage. Lunch for two, about 75 euros.If you have a kitchen where you are staying and are passing near Fonteblanda, order some fresh pasta from Vi.Ba (Di Balocchi e Viola), Via Monitianese 7, Fonteblanda).A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2016, on Page TR8 of the New York edition with the headline: Seduced by Maremma’s Off-Peak Mystique.
