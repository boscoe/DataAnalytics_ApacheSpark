Empty storefronts outnumbered its well-preserved 19th-century rowhouses, the remnants of working class Irish-Catholic immigrants who provided Corktown’s name. Public housing in the neighborhood’s Regent Park also seemed to inhibit newcomers. But as condos sprout on Corktown’s edges, small businesses are setting up along the main roads, King and Queen Streets. Corktown remains one of downtown’s quieter quarters, but the buzz around this historic patch keeps growing.Bruce Lee and Stephanie Duong opened this jewel-box bakery and pastry shop in February 2015 after studying culinary arts in Paris and Hong Kong; the lush banana cream pie éclair is a signature, along with meltingly soft caramels.362 King Street East; 416-368-8188; roselleto.comKettle bells and medicine balls decorate this loftlike restaurant opened by Josh Broun, a former personal trainer, last October; paleo breakfasts, intense bone broths and gluten-free pastries have made it a new power-dining spot.
