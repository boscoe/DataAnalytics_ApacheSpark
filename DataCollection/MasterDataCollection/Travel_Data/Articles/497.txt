But revitalization efforts are luring field-to-fork chefs, hops-obsessed brewers, eco-chic designers, craft brewers, single-estate coffee roasters and a crop of contemporary artists who are pushing the city’s artistic sensibility into the limelight. As the 12-block corridor surrounding Central Avenue takes on a more polished sheen, the atmosphere has remained original and proudly New Mexican, attracting legions of tourists and residents alike.This multifunctional market, open May through October, has re-energized the defunct former blacksmith shop of the Santa Fe Railroad. The proudly dowdy space with colorful windowpanes draws upward of 4,000 visitors every week and shows off upcycled architectural designs, block-printed T-shirts and seasonal bites (with red and green chiles). 777 First Street SW, 505-600-1109, railyardsmarket.com.This art space is at the core of the city’s diverse artisanal sensibility. Home to contemporary Southwestern ephemera, the space has served as an incubator for other artists and curators since opening 11 years ago. It also houses an essential map that guides visitors to galleries and hidden murals downtown. 516 Central Avenue SW, 505-242-1445, 516arts.org.Inspired by the dimly lit taverns of Andalusia, Spain, this tapas restaurant has been fusing traditional small plates with innovative twists since its opening in late 2015. Popular dishes include fried potatoes with Poblano aioli and lobster tostada with roasted tomato salsa.1025 Lomas Boulevard NW, 505-242-3117, thecellartapas.com.Clean, smooth wheat ales and chocolaty stouts made with roasted barley are on tap. The craft brewery opened early last year with a 40-seat tap room and a desert-toned patio. 413 Second Street SW, 505-288-6468, sidetrackbrewing.net.Juan and David Certain, political refugees of late-1990s Colombia, opened this single-estate coffeehouse in 2013, using only beans bred from their grandfather’s farm in the hills of Piendamó Cauca, a small town in central Colombia. Cozy up in one of the burlap-upholstered armchairs and watch the stylish denizens file in and out. 311 Gold Avenue SW, 505-363-9453, thebrewabq.com.Advertisement
