            Explore the map and find things to do in Washington, D.C.        No matter who occupies it, the White House remains an alluring spectacle; the lawn extending from the West Wing to the northwest gate offers an unimpeded view of aides and visitors coming and going, as well as the press corps huffing in the cold.The Capitol itself is — with apologies to the new Trump International Hotel — the most sumptuous architectural jewel in Washington, replete with portraits and busts of our nation’s statesmen (and a few rogues). It, along with the House and Senate office buildings, are open to the public, as are the underground tunnels that connect them.Evocations of historic Washington can be found in far-flung corners. On the northeastern boundary of Capitol Hill, the Historic Congressional Cemetery (congressionalcemetery.org) is the repository of numerous Washington notables, from early congressmen to the former F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover to assorted bootleggers, prostitutes and bankrupted developers.In Anacostia, the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site (nps.gov/frdo; $1.50 for reserved spots on the 30-minute tour) rests on Cedar Hill, overlooking the Capitol and beyond. Nearly all of its 21 rooms retain their original décor, including Douglass’s books and musical instruments.AdvertisementIn Petworth, a community of war veterans resides on 250 acres that include President Lincoln’s Cottage at the Soldiers’ Home (LincolnCottage.org, $15). The residence contains a few period pieces, none of Lincoln’s ownership. An unexpected bonus awaits in the visitors’ center: an exhibit relating to Lincoln’s forceful role in the passage of the 1864 Immigration Act, accompanied by narratives from recent émigrés.AdvertisementTo say that the Washington food scene has improved markedly is both to speak the unassailable truth and to grade on a generous curve. Other cities along the Acela corridor remain superior dining destinations, but it’s still a welcome fact that one can now eat well in the capital.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For my money, the best meat in town is served at the Argentine restaurant Del Campo (dinner for two without wine, $100).A welcome profusion of excellent Vietnamese, Thai and Korean (in addition to the longstanding Ethiopian) restaurants means that treks to outer Arlington or Silver Spring are no longer necessary. Among upscale fare, Komi and Minibar are worth the monumental effort it takes to get a table.Convivial and Tail Up Goat are among the more interesting additions, but the most consistently excellent restaurant to open within the last five years feels refreshingly un-This Town: the Red Hen (dinner for two without wine, $75). The atmosphere is gregarious, the food fundamentally Italian, while the offbeat beverage list is the brainchild of the wine director, Sebastian Zutant, without whom Washingtonians might still be stuck with California cabernets.Washington’s watering holes are Balkanized in accordance with one’s tribe. White House visitors congregate in the legendary basement bar of the Hay-Adams Hotel appropriately named Off the Record, or in the cozy dark bar of the Bombay Club, an excellent Indian restaurant. An air of serious business eternally pervades Quill, the handsome bar at the Jefferson Hotel — though after 9 p.m. Peter Robinson takes his seat at the piano and crooners join in on classics by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. Discerning Hill aides often head to the Capitol Lounge for draft beer, or Barrel, for whiskey. Patrons of Sonoma,  with its good Mediterranean food and lengthy list of wines by the glass, include several members of Congress, as well as those like me who have interviewed dozens of them in the back booths.A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2017, on Page TR9 of the New York edition with the headline: At Home in Washington.
