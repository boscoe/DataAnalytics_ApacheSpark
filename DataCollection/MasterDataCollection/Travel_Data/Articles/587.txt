On the west side of the Urumea are most of the Basque city’s main attractions: The Old Town packed with pintxo bars, the bay of La Concha, its golden beaches and elegant promenade. But to the east is Gros, a low-key neighborhood behind Zurriola beach that is fast becoming the best area to shop in the city. Forget kitschy souvenirs and chain stores; this welcoming neighborhood caters to residents, with shops focused on what’s local, from bookshelves and bathing suits to take-away beers worth a stroll across the river.Warm plastic cups of San Miguel beer on the beach are a thing of the past. Since opening next to Zurriola beach last year, this sunny yellow beer shop has been pouring pilsners and pale ales into beach-ready PET bottles with stick-on labels and cute brown-paper bags. The 18 taps feature many local craft brews, like the Kong IPA from Naparbier, a brewery in the nearby town of Navarra.Avenida de Zurriola 36; 34-943-321-409; kainabikaina.comIf the merchandise inside this furniture and interior design shop looks familiar, it may be because the owners have also installed their signature oak-and-iron wares in many locales around town. In addition to polished wooden armchairs and minimalist coffee tables, this shop stocks lamps, candles, prints and ceramics from local artisans.Avenida de Zurriola 1; 34-943-083-340; boisetfer.esDown a half flight of stairs, this easy-to-miss shop doubles as a showroom for the local fashion label Kionita.

Now, beneath high ceilings and exposed vents, local designs are displayed alongside denim from the Danish designer Anine Bing, slouchy knits from the Catalan brand Sita Murt and tasseled suede boots made in Italy.Calle Nueva 5; 34-943-105-536; facebook.com/lacentralgrosWhat began as a pop-up bakery in a retrofitted shipping container has expanded into a mini-chain of local shops, including this bright storefront across from Zurriola beach, where freshly baked croissants, buttery palmiers and loaves of special turmeric-spiced pan de cúrcuma tempt passers-by through huge floor-to-ceiling windows.Avenida de Zurriola 18; 34-943-265-030; theloaf.esAdvertisement
