The Big Blackfoot, which runs just outside of Missoula, is the setting for Norman Maclean’s acclaimed novella “A River Runs Through It.” It’s also as pretty a stream as you’ll find. Good-sized brown and rainbow trout can be found among the boulder-strewn rapids and deep-green pools, but wild, native westslope cutthroats are the prize catch here. Big Blackfoot Outfitters (3055 North Reserve Street, Suite A-1, Missoula; 406-542-7411) runs full-day guided trips, including lunch and gear, from $500. The Resort at Paws Up (40060 Paws Up Road, Greenough; 877-580-6343) offers private cabins, lodges and luxury tents from $1,195 per night. (Read more on a trip to Big Blackfoot inspired by the book.)Known as the birthplace of American fly-fishing, the Beaverkill, which runs 44 miles through the Catskill Mountains in New York, is particularly beautiful in the fall. The nearby West Branch of the Delaware River is arguably the East Coast’s top wild rainbow-trout fishery. The Beaverkill Valley Inn (beaverkillvalleyinn.com; 845-439-4844; from $245 per night, with meals), in Lew Beach, is a charming country cottage, with exclusive access to a prime mile-long stretch of its namesake river. The inn can provide a list of guides; rates from $350.The Henry’s Fork is known as the graduate school of fly-fishing for good reason. Twisting 127 miles through Southeastern Idaho, the river can be technical, but the rewards — brown trout and rainbows sometimes measuring 20 inches or more — are worth it. Three Rivers Ranch (threeriversranch.com; 208-652-3750; from $1,249 per night, guided fishing and meals included), in Warm River, is an upscale-rustic lodge that is run by the great-granddaughter of 1920s Idaho homesteaders, set hard on Robinson Creek, a lovely small stream in its own right.When people think of blue-ribbon trout fishing, they tend to picture gin-clear water winding past fields of sagebrush beneath snow-capped peaks. That’s the Madison. From its headwaters in Yellowstone National Park to its confluence with the Missouri River 183 miles later, there is no more storied angling destination. Firehole Ranch (fireholeranch.com; 406-646-7294; from $1,200 per night, guided fishing and meals included), offers deluxe Western cabins and convenient access to the equally sought-after West Yellowstone, Gallatin and Firehole rivers.
