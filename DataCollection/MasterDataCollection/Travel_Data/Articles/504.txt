AdvertisementSupported byBy The New York TimesThe unofficial end of summer is already here so it’s time to reminisce. We asked some of our favorite authors what they tried for the first time in summers’ past: Francine Prose went on a scary ride at Coney Island. Alexander Chee learned how to take a real vacation. And Joyce Maynard celebrated love and life on the back of a motorcycle. We also asked our readers what they tried for the first time during summer vacation and got hundreds of responses. Here are some edited excerpts. Headed to Kansas City, Mo., to see the total solar eclipse, which is not visible in Ontario, Canada, where I live. — Janis RapaportWe did a one-day excursion to Petra, Jordan, from Eilat, Israel. The trip to Petra was amazing, but the end was terrible. We boarded a bus to Petra and returned to the Israel border at night. Because my wife was born in Israel, they talked to her extensively. The tour bus, without even telling us, left the area to return to Eilat. After waiting more than 40 minutes in the hope that the company would send a car for us, the border control finally called us a cab. — Marty Schonberger I zoomed around the streets of Hue, Vietnam, on the back of a motorbike, dodging cars, trucks and a panicked cow. — Mary Alice McLoughlinI climbed the 668 steps to the second level of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. — Gail Miller After the sudden and devastating death of my 24-year-old son in April, I needed to grab on to life. I traveled alone to Australia to begin a journey of the spirit (Aboriginal Uluru and Kata Tjuta) and appreciation of nature (Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest) in my son’s memory. — Juli HarrisI did a handstand with one hand on each side of the Equator. — Stacy KisselI canoed the Gowanus Canal! Who knew?! — Cassie LovettI solo hiked up Mont Tremblant, in Quebec, four times, using four different routes, and revived my soul. — Jonathan Green Advertisement
