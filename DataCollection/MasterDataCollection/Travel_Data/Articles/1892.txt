As Seattle becomes increasingly unaffordable to those raking in less than six figures, White Center, the unincorporated suburb to its south, has attracted a soulful blend of entrepreneurs, striking an elusive balance between gritty and friendly. It has an uncommonly diverse mix of residents and restaurants and a staggering number of pinball machines per capita. Some of its adult-oriented businesses — pornography, poker and marijuana — speak to its rough-and-tumble roots, flourishing there because of the tight restrictions of its more affluent neighbor to the north.Mike and Stefanie Albaeck, who have two young children, created a decidedly familial environment when they opened this pizzeria in 2009. It has a photo booth and play area to keep the young ones busy while their parents wash down New York-style slices with beer brewed down the street and admire local artists’ work on the walls.9622A 16th Avenue SW, 206-432-9765, proletariatpizza.com.With folding chairs and weeds peeking out of the asphalt, this eight-year-old microbrewery’s patio is inelegant but functional. Regulars — “a lot of bachelors and teachers,” says the owner, Alejandro Brown — host weekly barbecues (when it’s sunny out) and potlucks (when Seattle’s weather lives up to its soaking stereotype), enjoying delicious smoked porter that tastes like a mezcal float.9832 14th Avenue SW; 206-453-4487; bigalbrewing.com.This spot, established in 1947, is perhaps the busiest dive bar in the 206 area code. It opens at 6 a.m., empty barstools are scarce at virtually every hour, and the bartenders are dizzyingly efficient. It helps that they’re rarely forced to concoct libations more complicated than Wild Turkey on ice or a draft of Busch.Advertisement9633 16th Avenue SW; 206-762-9805.In late 2015, Johnny LeMaster, who owns one of Seattle’s oldest bars, Jules Maes Saloon, opened this space, which, back when it was known as Papa’s Pub, was the site of a huge drug and gun bust in 2011. Mr. LeMaster’s bar serves eclectic food — the pork buns are fantastic — and quality cocktails without a whiff of pretentiousness.9635 16th Avenue SW, 206-420-7574, noblebarton.com.In 2011, a world-class skater named Josh Rhoads and his wife, Erin, revived Southgate Roller Rink, which was once the home of the Rat City Rollergirls. Southgate still hosts roller derby events, as well as family nights, karaoke (you haven’t really lived until you’ve belted out Pat Benatar while wheeling into a wall) and a monthly party for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender skaters.Advertisement9646 17th Avenue SW, 206-707-6949, southgaterollerrink.com.A version of this article appears in print on August 7, 2016, on Page TR4 of the New York edition with the headline: South of Seattle, a Grittier Vibe.
