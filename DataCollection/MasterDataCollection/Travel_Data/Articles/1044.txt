A night tour of one of Scotland’s most famous modern ruins, St. Peter’s Seminary, above, will open the country’s first Festival of Architecture. For the ticketed event, called Hinterland, held March 18 to 27, audiences will walk through woodlands to explore the derelict buildings, backed by moving light installations and a specially commissioned recorded choral work performed by St. Salvator’s Chapel Choir of the University of St. Andrews. Built 50 years ago, the structure was heralded as a modernist masterpiece of glass and concrete, but fell into disrepair after being deconsecrated in 1980. A planned restoration will transform it into an arts facility.The architectural festival will also feature more than 400 events and exhibitions around the country. Flagship attractions include the Ideal Hut Show, a touring show from May to September featuring 20 model garden sheds customized by leading architects, designers and celebrities.A version of this article appears in print on January 24, 2016, on Page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: Lights at Night .
