What does the rhythm of life sound like in 2016? Drums are keeping traditions alive in Basque Country and Burkina Faso; California is calling on the voices of strong women to inspire new music; and in Montreal, jazz lovers are preparing for what is sure to be the classiest Battle of the Bands in history.Pack your earplugs and head to San Sebastián, Spain, for La Tamborrada (Jan. 20), one of the oddest and, surely, most annoying musical traditions in the world. Every year on the feast of St. Sebastián, more than 100 local drum regiments parade through the city’s Plaza de la Constitución, beating buckets and drums for 24 hours, a custom thought to have begun during the Peninsular War, when villagers filling their buckets with water from the plaza’s well began to mock Napoleon’s soldiers, who were occupying the city.
                It’s a big world out there, so we’ve narrowed it down for you. From the temples of Malta to the crystalline waters of the Yucatán, explore our top destinations to visit this year.            Drummers are most often dressed in peasant costumes, as soldiers or as chefs, a practice with varied explanations, none of which ring quite true. It may have something to do with the large dinners hosted by local food clubs the night before, a big bonus in a city already well known for its culinary expertise.Rooted in age-old West African traditions, Festima (Feb. 27 to March 5), held every other year in Dédougou, Burkina Faso, is a different kind of cacophony, mixing drumming with dance and, most important, mask-making. Musicians with hand drums, whistles and balafons, xylophone-like instruments made with gourds, pound out rhythms while dancers, masked to look like animals and bush spirits, perform and interact with spectators. Storytelling competitions and presentations on the history of regional mask-making and culture are also part of the festivities, which began in 1996 with a group of students hoping to preserve these traditions. Arrive well rested, as impromptu dance sessions often keep visitors up till the wee hours.AdvertisementIn March, two freshman fests, the Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival (March 4 to 6) in Florida and Paradise Lost (March 10 to 12), Jamaica’s first electronic dance music festival, make their debuts with impressive lineups.Every Saturday, get travel tips, destination coverage, photos from all over the world and more.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In Ocho Rios, Paradise Lost is to have Bassnectar and Tiësto leading a pack of rising E.D.M. artists on a beachfront stage, including King Jammy, a Jamaican-born music maker who organizers said will help keep the fest tethered to its roots.AdvertisementNestled between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley’s luxury spas and inns can be a respite for city dwellers. The Ojai Music Festival (June 9 to 12) assists, providing music to soothe — and inspire — the soul for the last 69 summers.For this, its 70th anniversary season, the focus will be “pushing boundaries, great music grounded in spiritual and political context,” said Thomas W. Morris, the festival’s artistic director. Concerts include an evening honoring Josephine Baker, led by the soprano Julia Bullock; songs inspired by the 2011 Egyptian revolution from Dina El Wedidi, an Egyptian vocalist; and from Kaija Saariaho, a Finnish composer, the American premiere of her “La Passion de Simone,” which is based on the life of Simone Weil, a French philosopher.And in Montreal this summer, you’ll find the usual jazz royalty — Wynton Marsalis, Gregory Porter, Stacey Kent — at the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal (June 29 to July 9). But the one true king will be crowned at the festival’s now wildly popular Battle of the Bands, when the Cab Calloway Orchestra returns to Montreal for the first time in 25 years to challenge a battle favorite, the Glenn Miller Orchestra. And while head-banging is unlikely, some pretty snazzy solos are guaranteed.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2016, on Page TR10 of the New York edition with the headline: Sounds of Music From Around the World.
