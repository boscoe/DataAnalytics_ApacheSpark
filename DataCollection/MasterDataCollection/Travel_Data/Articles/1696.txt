Geraldine Brooks, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Pamela Paul and others in the literary world reveal their favorite bookstores.
My favorite bookstore is the one I get to see the least these days: Eso Won Books in Los Angeles. I’m a child of the Black Power movement raised on the notion that the black diaspora was not just in need of its own particular politics, but of its own particular canon. Whereas other writers built themselves on Proust, Niebuhr and Camus, I was schooled by Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer and C.L.R. James.Eventually I grew to understand that Dead White Men were more than that, and that my canon had to be more than a political statement. But my roots are what they are, and when you grow up in a world that denigrates those roots, they tend to grow deep.Eso Won is one among a long tradition of black bookstores that sprang up to water those roots. It is part of the larger community of independent bookstores that writers celebrate, but its specific mission is to make sure black authors always have a home. This is important to me, not because it’s the world that I spring from but because it is the river I continue to drink from. On tour for my first book, I spent a solid hour there not just perusing the books but getting recommendations on what to read. I came home with Paula J. Giddings’s awesome biography of the pioneering investigative journalist Ida B. Wells, “Ida: A Sword Among Lions.” While I knew Giddings’s work before then, it was the conversation I had in the bookstore that sold me on it.In much the same way we need diversity among authors and editors, we need diversity among the ranks of booksellers. They are the ultimate arbiters of our literary tradition. In these coming dark times, we can scarcely afford to be without them.Ta-Nehisi Coates is the author of “Between the World and Me.”Just walking into Hatchards, London’s oldest bookseller and “by appointment royal booksellers to Her Majesty the Queen,” feels like a privilege. Situated off Piccadilly Circus, Hatchards offers a refuge from the hubbub of commercial London, even though it’s now owned by the megachain Waterstones.Though the store has been remodeled several times, it retains an Old World feel and a determinedly British cast, with wooden banistered staircases and a carpet bearing the design of a book spine published by Hatchards in the Victorian era. Walls display quotes such as this one, from Kingsley Amis: “If you can’t annoy somebody with what you write, I think there’s little point in writing.” Not surprisingly, writers adore Hatchards, with John le Carré, Ruth Rendell and Antonia Fraser among its loyal fans.Yes, Hatchards has an unabashedly clubby feel, but it’s one that recognizes all readers as members. Everyone here is a book person, from the cashiers to the floor managers, and the displays feel especially welcoming to bookish types. Themed tables are labeled by quotes rather than categories. A table on contemporary politics, for example, bears a quote from Lord Acton: “History is not a burden on the memory, but an illumination of the soul.”The stock is at once comprehensive and well curated. Primacy of place goes to books by and about lords and dames of English letters such as Winston Churchill, George Orwell and Muriel Spark. One table offers books purely on birding. In Britain, publishers are more widely recognized for their taste and style, and Hatchards allows this to shine through with tables displaying an entire season from the tiny Pushkin Press, “Frightfully Fabulous Fabers” and the full Penguin Books Great Ideas series.This may make the atmosphere sound snooty; it’s not. A lively table is dedicated to drinking, and the crime selection is vast; one display label reads “In the library, with the revolver.” P.G. Wodehouse gets his own shelf, as does Roald Dahl. The children’s section is a happy place complete with stuffed Gruffalos and pages from The Daily Prophet. One is grateful to be let in and to feel at home.Pamela Paul is the editor of The New York Times Book Review and author of the forthcoming memoir “My Life With Bob.”The place is small and irregular in shape. From the outside, it looks as if a door has been carelessly left open in a house with a brick facade and barred windows. Bookshelves cover the walls as you enter; in the center of the small room there’s a desk that I can’t describe, because books always hide it — hide its surface, of course, but also its front and sides, so that the bookseller seems to greet you from within a trench of printed pages.Álvaro Castillo, the sole proprietor of San Librario, always keeps his door open, but it is not really a welcoming gesture: It is just that the place is so small that the smell of old paper would make breathing difficult.San Librario is a celebrated yet almost secret secondhand bookstore in northern Bogotá. It is unpredictable, both in its contents and in the way they are displayed, which makes browsing an adventure of uncertain outcome. More than once I have wandered in looking for a Colombian out-of-print novel and found, literally next to it, that early translation of a Russian political essay I had been looking for. All this happens under the bemused eyes of the bookseller, who mysteriously, telepathically, is sharing your curiosity, participating in your discoveries.I’ve known Álvaro for 23 years. (I’ve seen his ponytail come and go, but his Lennon glasses seem eternal.) I used to visit as a student to get affordable copies of the great Latin American novels and stories — Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Julio Cortázar, Mario Vargas Llosa — that were already shaping my obsessions as I began to write myself. Now I visit for the rare books, those first editions that nobody else can find, and for the passionate conversation about, well, rare books that nobody else can find.Yes, this is why San Librario, incapable of holding more than three customers at a time, has become a favorite bookstore: because few people understand as Álvaro does the deep thrill of holding the first edition of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” or taking home a copy of Julio Cortázar’s “Hopscotch” with an inscription by the great José Lezama Lima. But maybe the reason I keep going is that feeling that lies between cruelty and tenderness: When he sells me the first edition of Mario Vargas Llosa’s “The Green House,” he is not happy to part with it. He holds the book with stubborn fingers, even as he takes the payment, as if it were a pet, as if it were a little puppy he’s only letting go because he knows it will be in good hands.Juan Gabriel Vásquez is the author of “Reputations.”The Jazzhole is easy to miss — tucked next to a pharmacy on Awolowo Road, a busy, traffic-packed road crammed on either side with banks and businesses. Lagos is nearly always hot and sticky, and it makes me happy to walk into its cool and darkish interior and to be filled instantly with the expectation of discovery. Tables with books spread out like invitations. A range of fiction, from Lisa Gardner to Tash Aw. Biographies, histories, poetry. Large, hardcover art books propped on shelves. Framed images on the walls of iconic book covers, musicians, nationalists. A traditional drum hanging from the wall. A music section with CDs of both old and new music from Africa and Europe and America.The Jazzhole is a bookstore, a music store, a cultural haven. It is a space reverential of stories and history. Its casual, lived-in charm encourages browsing, and I have discovered beloved books there — books about Africa, in particular. It is also the place in Lagos to go to for new British and American book releases. I have attended live music events there, with the bookshelves pushed back to fit in seating. I have had delicious cake and fresh juice from the tiny cafe at the back.It feels human, it feels like a place warmly welcoming of all kinds of people. If you’re lucky, you might run into the owners, Kunle and Tundun Tejuosho. Kunle, quiet and introverted, a walking archive of African music, and Tundun, warm and exuberantly intelligent. Genuine people and genuine lovers of culture.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author of three novels, most recently “Americanah.”I came late to bookstores. Money was tight in our Sydney family, so books came from the library, and the trip on Saturday afternoon was as ingrained a ritual as Sunday Mass, perhaps even more sacred.It wasn’t until I was in my 20s, when the pleasures of building a personal library began. It was a distant bookstore, not a local one, that first drew my allegiance. I was a reporter, covering the environment, and was often in Tasmania where many of Australia’s most important conservation battles of the 1980s raged. The state capital, Hobart, is a lovely city, tumbling down the slopes of Mount Wellington and fanning out around the luminous Derwent River estuary under a vast and ever-changing sky.Fullers Bookshop became my second home. I went there to get warm on a wintry afternoon, to strike up conversations with thoughtful booksellers and to find insights about Tasmania in the books by local authors that they recommended, and that the bookstore often published. It’s a venerable store, established by Bill Fuller in 1920, run by a pair of jazz musicians through the 1960s and ’70s. It bounced around town, driven from place to place by rents and development pressure.But the store was always more about the people than the premises. Clive Tilsley, the current owner, bought Fullers in 1982 and now, at last, it has found a glorious physical home in a bright space with a view of craggy Mount Wellington and a very fine cafe. My favorite element is a chair: a circular three-seater that has traveled from shop to shop for 25 years. This oddity crossed the world, from the foyer of a Manchester, England, theater, then to Chicago, before finding its Hobart home atop a jewel-colored Persian rug among the well-stocked bookshelves.Geraldine Brooks is the author of “The Secret Chord.”Christopher Isherwood once wrote about the importance of Penguin paperbacks to lonely travelers, “Oh well, all right, I can face this place if I must, as long as there’s Penguins.” I feel something similar about the Strand Book Store. I can get through any kind of bleak day in Manhattan, as long as there’s a visit to the Strand planned for later.The Strand’s motto, printed on its T-shirt and tote bags, is “18 Miles of Books.” I’ve been shopping there so long that I have a tattered Strand shirt that reads: “8 Miles of Books.” It’s a vast, independent, family-owned bookstore, founded in 1927, that spreads across three and a half floors of a building on lower Broadway. It sells used books and new ones, usually at bargain prices, and it’s a place to get lost in.In a stairwell there is a framed copy of an old Liz Smith gossip column about the time Michael Jackson kept the store open two hours after closing, as he bought biographies of men like Marvin Gaye and Howard Hughes. Here, finally, I thought as I read this, is a reason to hanker for wealth and fame.Many rockers, early in their careers, worked at the Strand, notably Patti Smith and Tom Verlaine. The store currently has about 200 employees, and they’re unionized. (To get a job at the Strand, you must first pass a book quiz.) If your children are with you, you can take them to the Young Adult section on the second floor, where they can sit on the bench featured in the film adaptation of John Green’s novel “The Fault in Our Stars.”Many movies, including “Six Degrees of Separation” and “Julie & Julia,” have scenes that take place at the Strand. It’s a New York institution, and walking inside gives you that expansive feeling you get walking into other great Manhattan institutions like the Grand Central Oyster Bar and Carnegie Hall. You enter this shrine to literacy and you think: This is why I live here.Dwight Garner is a book critic for The Times.The Amsterdam thoroughfare called the Beethovenstraat does not live up to its namesake. It isn’t particularly dramatic or romantic or turbulent. Rather, it’s a quiet shopping street in a leafy neighborhood of stately brick buildings — a suitable environment for a contemplative bookstore, and that’s what the Boekhandel Van Rossum is. The store began life in 1929 as the neighborhood itself was being developed. In 1997, Beth Johnson, a small, bright-faced American woman, bought it, kept the name and moved it across the street. Then a few years ago, at a time when everyone else was convinced that the physical book was headed the way of the woolly mammoth, she doubled down: took over the adjoining space and radically renovated.The result is an elegant warren of new-construction, old-school bookish loveliness. Van Rossum is a place where a nook is a nook. It’s elegant but cozy. It’s got your leather chairs, your seemingly random placement of tables with seemingly random, but in fact artfully chosen, titles. Beth — who, full disclosure, is a friend — went for a restrained Art Deco design that matches the neighborhood. The pièce de résistance is an archway shaped like a giant key in which the bookshelves follow its contours.Amsterdam has always been a deeply literary city. During the 17th century, its printers produced something like one-third of all books published in the world. That’s the tradition Van Rossum follows. One might logically expect a bookstore expansion to involve a cafe, but when she extended her store, Beth went all in: no food or drinks, no toys, no tchotchkes. Just books. There are serious books and lighter fare; there are kids’ books. Most are in Dutch, but there’s a sizable English section. The store is a fresh and quiet space, a sober and calm one. Stepping inside is like, well, the feeling of cracking open a new book.Beth told me that her modest objective in expanding her shop was the “broadening of horizons in a world where people only want to have one opinion and no one to challenge them to view a situation from another perspective.” If a bookstore were to change the world, that would be the way to do it.Russell Shorto is the author of “Amsterdam: A History of the World’s Most Liberal City.”An article last Sunday about several authors’ favorite bookstores referred incorrectly to items for sale in an Amsterdam bookstore. The Boekhandel Van Rossum does in fact sell calendars. An accompanying picture caption repeated the error. Advertisement
