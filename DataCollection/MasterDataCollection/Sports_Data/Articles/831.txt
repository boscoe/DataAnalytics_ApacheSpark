HARTFORD, Conn. — Connecticut tied its N.C.A.A. record with its 90th consecutive victory, routing No. 20 South Florida, 102-37, on Tuesday night.Saniya Chong scored 20 points, leading six players in double figures for the top-ranked Huskies, who matched the program’s record streak from November 2008 to December 2010.UConn (15-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference) has a chance to break the record on Saturday at Southern Methodist in Dallas.“Some things you just can’t really explain; you just have to enjoy it,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “We don’t set out to do these kinds of things. We don’t set out to set records, break records or keep track of records. We set out to play as hard as we can.”AdvertisementMaria Jespersen had 11 points for South Florida (13-2, 2-1), which has never beaten UConn in 21 tries.Chong hit a 3-pointer to start a 9-0 opening run, and the Huskies quickly extinguished any South Florida hopes for an upset. Connecticut led by 22 after the first 10 minutes. Another 3 by Chong gave the Huskies their first 40-point lead, at 53-13, with four minutes left in the second quarter.The score was 65-19 at halftime.South Florida Coach Jose Fernandez had decided before the tipoff to try to match UConn’s transition game. But the Huskies were more than able to run with the Bulls. UConn outscored South Florida by 18-5 in fast-break points and by 48-14 in the paint. Chong had eight of UConn’s 31 assists. South Florida had three.UConn has not lost since a 2-point defeat in overtime at Stanford, then ranked sixth, on Nov. 17, 2014.

South Florida is 64-13 over that stretch against every other opponent.After the game, UConn stayed on the court to watch a congratulatory video made by former players as fans held up signs reading, “90 and Counting.”A version of this article appears in print on January 11, 2017, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: 90th Win in a Row by UConn Ties a Mark.
