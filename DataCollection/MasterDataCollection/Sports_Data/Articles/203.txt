In a 36-hole sectional qualifier where only two of the 35 players advanced, Romo opened with a 71 and withdrew in the afternoon after two weather delays.Orville Moody in 1969 was the last player to go through local qualifying and win the U.S. Open.A version of this article appears in print on May 4, 2017, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Golf; Romo Hopes to Play in the U.S. Open.
