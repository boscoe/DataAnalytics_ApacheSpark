The Super Bowl. The World Series. The Final Four. Big events that determine championships tend to have short, memorable names.Then there is the College Football Playoff National Championship.It doesn’t exactly sing.“It’s my dream to one day play in the College Football Playoff National Championship.” “If we keep this up, we’ll get to play in the College Football Playoff National Championship.” “I’d love to land College Football Playoff National Championship tickets.”Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney just may have solved the awkward phraseology with a single exuberant outburst on Thursday night. After his team beat Oklahoma, 37-17, in a semifinal, he happily told a waiting microphone:“All I know is, we’re going to the Natty!”

For example, a Nebraska volleyball player, Mikaela Foecke, told the Nebraska sports website Hail Varsity last month, “We say, ‘Natty now,’ and we’re going after the national championship.”AdvertisementBut the word is more commonly used as an adjective meaning “spiffy,” as the name of the main character in “The Last of the Mohicans,” or as a slang term for Natural Light beer.AdvertisementSwinney’s proclamation, prominently played on ESPN Thursday and Friday, has a chance to popularize the term in a sporting context.Twitter users seemed to be doing their part Thursday night:
            The Natty will be Kirby's last game on the Alabama sideline lets send him and the seniors out with a W! #RollTide 
            Holy congratulations Batman, @ClemsonFB is in the 'Natty'! #ALLIN #GoTigers 
            All my childhood dreams came true this year...marriage...baby....CLEMSON goin to National Champs!!!! #Winning #Natty #2015        Finding just the right name for a big game is tricky and sometimes takes time. The Super Bowl was originally the A.F.L.-N.F.L. World Championship Game. The N.C.A.A. Division I Ice Hockey Championship semifinals and finals were played for years before someone discovered that “Frozen Four” was a lot more memorable.Not every effort succeeds. In its single season, the X.F.L. first tried the meta-named “Big Game at the End of the Season,” before settling on “The Million Dollar Game.”

Consider the 1990’s-era Poulan Weed-Eater Independence Bowl. (It was played, oddly enough, on artificial turf.) In the years since, the game has been known as the PetroSun Independence Bowl and the Duck Commander Independence Bowl and is currently the Camping World Independence Bowl. Perhaps they will keep trying.Nascar’s Brickyard 400 at Indy is formally “Crown Royal Presents the ‘Your Hero’s Name Here’ 400 at the Brickyard.” In the early 2000’s, the ARCA racing series offered the “Pork The Other White Meat 400.”Words come and go. Sometimes new terms catch on; other times they start to seem dated after a few years. It remains to be seen if Natty becomes as iconic as Champions League or as stale as soccer’s long-forgotten Intertoto Cup.It does have brevity and the exuberance of Dabo Swinney going for it. The N.C.A.A. may want to think about heading for the trademark office.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
