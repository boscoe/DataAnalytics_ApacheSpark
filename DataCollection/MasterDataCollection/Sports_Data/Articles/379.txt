PHILADELPHIA — The most popular group in the second round of the N.F.L. draft was nearly 3,000 miles away from Philadelphia: the Washington Huskies secondary.Three members — cornerbacks Kevin King and Sidney Jones, and safety Budda Baker — were taken in the first 11 picks Friday night.But none of those choices drew the attention that Cincinnati’s pick at No. 48 over all did: Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon, who was not invited to the scouting combine because in 2014 he had been filmed punching a woman, breaking bones in her face.Mixon was suspended from the team for a year after the altercation but came back and had two strong seasons. In 2016, he was an All-Big 12 performer who set the team record for all-purpose yardage in a season.AdvertisementFans in the draft theater booed aggressively when the former Bengals tackle Anthony Munoz, a Hall of Famer, announced the choice of Mixon. Cincinnati has a history of adding players with off-field problems to the roster.Bengals Coach Marvin Lewis admitted that some fans might “pause for a second” because of the selection. “But this thing’s got to move forward,” Lewis said, “and he’s got to move on. He’s lived with this since the day it’s occurred.”AdvertisementEarlier, King’s extra-long stay at the draft — he was one of five players attending who were not taken in the opening round — ended swiftly. King, a 6-foot-3 former safety, was taken by Green Bay as the first selection in the second round. He is not particularly speedy but has the size and the aggressiveness that pro teams seek.A version of this article appears in print on April 29, 2017, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Bengals Pick Player Who Punched Woman.
