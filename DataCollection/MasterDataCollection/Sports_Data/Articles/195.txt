Jeptoo is a three-time winner of the Boston Marathon and a two-time winner in Chicago.In October, the Court of Arbitration for Sport extended Jeptoo’s ban  to four years from two. The court, based in Switzerland, ruled that Jeptoo had engaged in “deceptive and obstructive conduct” during the legal proceedings.The court also said that Jeptoo had received at least one injection of EPO from an unnamed doctor in Kenya in 2014 and that she “hid the visits to the doctor in question from her manager and coach.”Some 40 Kenyan athletes have tested positive for banned substances in recent years, which has cast a shadow over the East African country’s dominance in distance running.Rosa denied any involvement in doping. On Tuesday, as his trial was to begin, the charges were withdrawn, though the reasons were not fully explained publicly. According to news accounts, the accusations could be reinstated after further investigation.“There was no case, no evidence proved,” Rosa said, adding that Jeptoo had never accused him of assisting her with banned substances.James Nyiha, Rosa’s lawyer, said in a statement to Reuters: “My client should not have been charged in the first place. The state did not have an iota of evidence against my client.”Rosa and his father, Gabriele Rosa, a prominent coach and cardiologist from Brescia, Italy, have long helped develop distance running with training camps in Kenya.Runners they have coached or managed through the years include Paul Tergat, a former world-record holder in the marathon; Sammy Wanjiru, the 2008 Olympic marathon champion; Stanley Biwott, the winner of the 2015 New York City Marathon; and Jemima Sumgong, who won the gold medal in the women’s marathon at the Rio Olympics.The withdrawal of charges against Federico Rosa “is extremely important to us in order to show, once again, that we are clean,” Gabriele Rosa said in an email.Advertisement
