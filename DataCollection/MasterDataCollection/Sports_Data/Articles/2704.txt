MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin responded within hours Monday to accusations that his government ran a covert doping program for Russian Olympians and other elite athletes, indicating how seriously the Kremlin took the charges.The government often waits days to react to issues raised abroad, if it responds at all, but international sports competitions in general and the Olympics in particular are important to Mr. Putin.The president harnessed the success of the 2014 Winter Olympics at the Russian resort of Sochi as proof that he is the leader to bring the nation, as is said here, “off its knees” after the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union. The Russian haul of 33 medals, seven more than any other country, was offered as the evidence.Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer who led the World Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into Russian Olympic cheating, said Russia's security service was involved in the scheme.Monday’s damaging report by the World Anti-Doping Agency placed a large question mark over the Sochi medals, and it could well lead to the suspension of the entire Russian Olympic team from the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games, less than three weeks away. So Mr. Putin has little time to address a problem that strikes at his and Russia’s prestige.AdvertisementThe outline of how the Kremlin will play the issue was evident in his initial reaction. On the one hand, Mr. Putin went on at length with his boilerplate accusation that the decision was highly politicized, probably pushed by the sinister hand of the United States.AdvertisementYet he also pledged cooperation, saying Russia would suspend all those named in the report and complete its own investigation. The Kremlin made clear, however, that Vitaly Mutko — the minister of sport, and a Putin loyalist — would not be suspended, since he was not named.Mr. Mutko said the report would be examined carefully, but he called it “distressing” that it was based on the testimony from a former Russian official identified as the source of the doping scheme.
                The report by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer commissioned by WADA, confirmed “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Russia was involved in an elaborate doping scheme that stretched beyond the Sochi Games.            “Today he was called an honest man, a reliable source,” Mr. Mutko said. “This raises eyebrows.”The WADA news conference was broadcast live on state television, complete with the accusations that the F.S.B., the state security agency that Mr. Putin used to direct, helped run the doping program.In his reaction, Mr. Putin evoked the 1980 boycott of the Moscow Summer Games by much of the West over the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Russian boycott of Los Angeles four years later.“Today we see a dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports,” he said, warning of a brewing “schism.”
                A step-by-step look at how Russian agents used an elaborate scheme to swap out tainted urine samples for clean ones taken months earlier.            Given the demand by the American antidoping agency even before Monday’s news conference that Russia be suspended from the Olympics, Mr. Putin said that “one country’s national organization is again trying to dictate its will to the entire world sports community.”AdvertisementBoth the Russian news channels and RT, the Kremlin-funded English-language television news channel, skipped over the consequences for Rio and concentrated on questions about the evidence and accusations of an anti-Russia propaganda war.If the Russian team is banned, Mr. Putin will undoubtedly try to rally people around the flag and depict the punishment as the world ganging up the nation. He did that when broad economic sanctions were imposed on Russia after it grabbed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, and he has basically done so in every confrontation since.Few analysts thought that the doping issue would dent Mr. Putin’s popularity rating, which has hovered at 81 percent all year, according to the independent Levada Center polling organization.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the European morning.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Putin hopes to get Western economic sanctions lifted, however, so he will not want to escalate the rhetoric too much, Mr. Frolov said.As with most issues in Russia, where a vast majority of the people support the government and a small minority despair of its endless corruption, the reaction on social media diverged. Besides the supportive nationalists and the mocking opposition, there were a few calm voices suggesting there was too much to the WADA report to be invented.“To combat doping, we have to unite, instead of making a pariah of a single country,” Svetlana Zhurova, a 2006 ice skating Olympic champion and currently a member of Parliament, was quoted as telling the TASS news agency.“Who sits on WADA?” a man wrote on the website Vkontakte, a Russian version of Facebook. “You’re right, Americans and Canadians. Do you believe them? Well, then there are chemical weapons in Iraq, right, it’s just that they weren’t found.”Some officials said banning Russia from the Olympics was tantamount to ruining the Games, while others called for a pre-emptive boycott.Among critics, much was made of the accusation that an F.S.B. agent posing as a plumber helped to substitute urine samples of the Olympians. One critic suggested that urinating into bottles to make a star athlete look clean was now probably worthy of a secret medal for “duty to the motherland.”Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter @NeilMacFarquhar.Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on July 19, 2016, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Putin Cites Politics in Answer to Report.
