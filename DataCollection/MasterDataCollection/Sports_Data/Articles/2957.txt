The Atlantic Coast Conference’s football championship game, typically played in Charlotte, N.C., but pulled from the state earlier this month in response to a controversial North Carolina law, will be staged at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla., in December, the conference announced Thursday.As previously scheduled, the game, between the winners of the Atlantic and Coastal Divisions, will kick off the evening of Saturday, Dec. 3.Earlier this month, the A.C.C., a North Carolina-based conference that counts four universities in the state among its most prominent members, announced that it would move all of its neutral-site championship events out of the state for the coming academic year in response to a law, known as House Bill 2, that is seen to discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. That move came several days after the N.C.A.A. made a similar announcement about its championships, and a few months after the N.B.A. pulled its 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte.The A.C.C. championship game is no stranger to the state of Florida, and two teams in the state, Florida State and Miami, are conference members. But this is the first time the game will be held in Orlando.A version of this article appears in print on September 30, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: College Football; A.C.C. Title Game Is Moved to Orlando.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
