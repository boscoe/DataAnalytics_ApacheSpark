 Stay here for live updates and images from the route.In an extraordinary race of one, Mary Keitany of Kenya ran to her third consecutive victory on Sunday in the New York City Marathon, finishing completely out of sight of the rest of the field, in 2 hours 24 minutes 26 seconds. Pulling away from her rivals before the 10-mile mark and never needing to look back, she covered more than half of the course entirely alone.The men’s race was won by a 20-year-old Eritrean, Ghirmay Ghebreslassie, who pulled away from a tight pack of three at Mile 20 and blew kisses to his onlookers as he won in 2:07:51. He is the youngest winner in race history.Ghebreslassie was followed by Lucas Rotich of Kenya in second (2:08:53). Abdi Abdirahman, a Somali-born American who is based in Arizona, finished in third (2:11:23). Abdirahman, 39, is almost a generation older than Ghebreslassie.Keitany’s unexpected break from the lead pack threw the women’s race into early upheaval, as her competitors stretched out one by one along the course to jockey for the remaining two podium spots. The 2012 Olympic silver medalist, Sally Kipyego of Kenya, placed second in 2:28:01, and Molly Huddle of the United States, in her marathon debut, was third in 2:28:13.AdvertisementKeitany is the first woman to win three in a row since Grete Waitz won five from 1982 to 1986.As her pink sneakers bounced steadily off the pavement through the five boroughs, Keitany, 34, showed that she has no problem running alone — provided she has a chance to start at all. Though she is the second-fastest woman in history and her country’s record holder (2:18:37), Kenya left her off its Olympic team this year after she collided with Jemima Sumgong and fell in the London Marathon with about five miles to go and subsequently failed to win.AdvertisementThe snub left her to focus on her fall race. She chose to execute a bold maneuver against a weak field.Ghebreslassie, who won the world championship in Beijing in 2015 at age 19, finished in fourth place at the Rio Olympics this year. He is the first Eritrean citizen to win the New York City Marathon; the Eritrean-born Meb Keflezighi has also won, but as an American citizen.Gwen Jorgensen, who won gold in the triathlon at the Rio Olympics, finished in 14th in the women’s race, in 2:41:01.Join runners on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, near the start of the 40th New York City Marathon, which travels through all five boroughs of the city.Tatyana McFadden of the United States won her fourth consecutive New York City Marathon title, finishing the women’s wheelchair race in 1 hour 47 minutes 43 seconds.Manuela Schar of Switzerland was second in 1:49:28. Amanda McGrory of the United States was third in 1:53:15.McFadden was born in Russia, adopted by American parents and grew up in Maryland. She is among the most decorated Paralympic athletes in history. She finished second in a photo finish at the Rio Paralympics in September, narrowly losing to Zou Lihong of China. Zou was in Sunday’s field in New York, but was nowhere close when McFadden crossed the finish line in Central Park.The mystery of the Chinese Paralympic champion in the New York City Marathon took a while to unravel.AdvertisementThe champion, Zou Lihong, was supposed to re-enact a great showdown from the Rio Games, where she beat the favored American, Tatyana McFadden, by a hair in the wheelchair marathon. But when McFadden crossed the Central Park finish line as the champion on Sunday, she hadn’t seen Zou for miles. None of the competitors had. Questions to a race official yielded no clue as to what had happened.Here’s how Zou’s first U.S. competition ended.Some emerging American runners are making their marathon debuts today. The 2016 Olympians Molly Huddle, Kim Conley and Gwen Jorgensen have all used the past two months to graduate from their shorter Olympic distances to 26.2 miles.Huddle, a New York state native, has had a string of contentious finishes — an arm reach at the NYC Half Marathon this year, a premature celebration at the world championships last year. She’ll try to keep pace with Kenya’s Mary Keitany, who has lost only seven races in the past eight years.Huddle set the American record in the 10 kilometers at the Rio Olympics this summer and is America’s most promising rising marathon runner. The NYC Marathon now has a special prize purse for Americans, through the fifth finisher. The top American gets $25,000.
                When the winner of the New York City Marathon crosses the finish line on Sunday, some of the slowest finishers are likely to be running their third miles, just inside Brooklyn.            How fast can an Olympic gold medalist in a triathlon race a marathon? On two months of real training? Gwen Jorgensen, 30, is showing us. She won at Rio in August and announced immediately after that she would dive into straight into the marathon this fall, running New York with the rest of the pros. She’s got two events fewer in store for her, but her longest run to prepare has been only 16 miles — 10.2 miles short of what she’s undertaking today. She’s been cautious about predicting a goal, but Jorgensen has always been a strong runner, cultivating her talent on the distance teams at the University of Wisconsin-Madison before transitioning into triathlons. And she placed third at the US 10-mile championships recently, with a time that roughly translates to just under 2:30.Update: Jorgensen fell off the lead pace early and finished in 2:41:01.— Lindsay CrouseOn race day, New York Road Runners deploys thousands of volunteers to help get the 50,000 runners from Staten Island to the finish line in Central Park.Some of them hold long sticks with signs on top that read, “Have a ? Ask me.”This being New York, the questions range from the frantic to the snarky.A volunteer named Nancy said that many runners are so nervous they ask obvious questions, but just need reassurance. One runner called this state of confusion “maranoia.”AdvertisementOthers, presumably from out of town, ask where the train is to Staten Island as they stand at the ferry terminal waiting for a boat to take them there.Another runner asked a volunteer named Aisha where to buy a ticket for the ferry and, when told it was free, said, “There’s something for free in New York?” — Ken BelsonIn 2012, a New York Times editor (and runner) set out to examine the atmosphere and landmarks along the New York City Marathon route, one mile per day, in the 26 days leading up to the race.Just two days before the race, the marathon was canceled as the city reeled from Hurricane Sandy.Here are descriptions of Miles 1 through 24, left mostly intact from 2012, complete with dated references to the Nets’ new home (they’ve played at Barclays Center for over four years now) and TV shows like “Mad Men,” “30 Rock” and “Gossip Girl.”The entries on the final 2 miles and 385 yards are newly written: Just look at that obligatory reference to “Hamilton.”Here is Brian Fidelman’s mile-by-mile diary.We asked runners to show us their perspective on their road to race day. Turns out, plenty of them are pretty good photographers.
