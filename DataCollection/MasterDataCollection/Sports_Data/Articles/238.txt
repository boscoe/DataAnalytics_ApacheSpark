Chris Amon, a New Zealander who was considered one of the best Formula One drivers of his generation, although he never won a championship, died on Wednesday. He was 73.The cause was cancer, his family said. There was no information on where he died.Amon, who began racing as a teenager, competed in Formula One from 1963 to 1976. He competed in 96 races, took five pole positions and finished on the podium 11 times without winning.He won the 1966 Le Mans 24-hour race in a Ford GT40 with his fellow New Zealander Bruce McLaren, who was later killed in a racing accident. Amon’s death came shortly after the 50th anniversary of that victory.Amon spent the first four years of his Formula One career driving for the Lola, Lotus, Brabham, Cooper and McLaren teams before moving in 1967 to Ferrari, with which he spent three seasons. Mauro Forghieri, Ferrari’s technical director at the time, said Amon was “by far the best test driver I have ever worked with.”AdvertisementAmon’s major successes came in sports car races, including the International Trophy at the Silverstone Circuit in England, the 1,000 Kilometers of Monza in Italy, and the 24 Hours of Daytona in Florida.The American Formula One champion Mario Andretti once said that Amon had such bad luck in championship races that “if he became an undertaker, people would give up dying.” But Amon himself said he was fortunate to have survived in one of auto racing’s most dangerous eras.Advertisement“A lot of people say I was very unlucky, and I suppose in terms of results I was,” he said. “But one thing I do always say to people is that I am very lucky to be here.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
