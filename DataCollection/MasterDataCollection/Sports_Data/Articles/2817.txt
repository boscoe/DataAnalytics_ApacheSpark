On July 8, 1889, John L. Sullivan bettered Jake Kilrain in 75 rounds of what is widely accepted as a historic last: the final bare-knuckle heavyweight championship fight before gloved boxing became the preferred, and officially sanctioned, form of the sport.Anticipation of the prizefight drew nationwide press coverage. As the Page One story in The New York Times recounted, 3,000 fans boarded trains to a remote field in Mississippi to watch the fight, so out of the way because it was sanctioned by promoters but not lawmakers.But that did not stop the Louisiana attorney general from attending. As the opening line from that story summed up: “Never, during even a Presidential election, has there been so much excitement as there is here now, even when the brutal exhibition is over.”Advertisement
