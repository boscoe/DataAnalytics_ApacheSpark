The line between extending a winning streak and starting a losing streak can be a fine one, and the Yankees crossed it several times in their 4-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.There was the potential double-play grounder that shortstop Pete Kozma booted in the seventh inning, the bunt that Austin Romine might have let drop for another double play in the same inning, and ultimately the slider that Luis Severino hung to Avisail Garcia that sailed out of sight and put the game out of reach.A different outcome on any one of those plays could have kept alive the Yankees’ longest winning streak in nearly five years, not to mention — 14 games into the season — put them atop the American League East, a position they never reached in 2016.And the Yankees had yet another chance in the ninth inning, when they loaded the bases against their former closer David Robertson and had Aaron Judge, their hitter most likely to launch a baseball onto River Avenue, at the plate. Judge made solid contact, but only to rap a grounder to shortstop for a game-ending forceout.AdvertisementIt was a frustrating defeat that could lead to second-guessing. Had Manager Joe Girardi not chosen to give Chase Headley, his everyday third baseman, the night off, forcing Girardi to play the rarely used Kozma at short, who knows what might have happened on Melky Cabrera’s tailor-made double-play ball?AdvertisementBut the bottom line, to borrow one of Girardi’s favorite expressions, is this: The Yankees lost for the first time since April 8 because they could manage only four hits, none of which left the infield, while allowing two that left the ballpark.That is how a close game — the White Sox were clinging to a 1-0 lead until Garcia’s home run — becomes a tough loss. The Yankees’ offense, which had averaged more than six runs a game during the club’s eight-game winning streak, could get nothing going against White Sox starter Miguel Gonzalez, who handcuffed them for eight innings before faltering in the ninth.The Yankees’ pitching, so solid throughout their win streak, was solid again on Tuesday, with Severino working a career-high eight innings, allowing just three hits, walking none and striking out 10.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But we didn’t get it done.”But the futility of this game did not erase the encouraging signs the team had shown in its previous eight games. When the Yankees decided last July to part ways with Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller, Carlos Beltran and, soon afterward, Alex Rodriguez, it was assumed that a team built around young players would need at least a couple of years to ripen into a contender.But after the first 13 games of 2017, the Yankees found themselves with more wins than they managed all of last April — the horrific month that doomed them last season — and as many wins as any team in the American League.AdvertisementThey had managed it with a surprisingly efficient offense and an even more surprising pitching rotation, which had turned in quality starts in seven of their eight consecutive wins and had posted a 2.77 staff E.R.A.Severino, who had struck out 11 in seven innings in his last outing, a win over the Tampa Bay Rays, was every bit as good against the White Sox, an encouraging sign for a pitcher who looked like a potential Cy Young winner in his rookie season of 2015 but was relegated to the bullpen after going winless in 11 starts last season.“His stuff was as good tonight as we’ve seen it,” Girardi said. “It’s unfortunate we didn’t turn the double play in the seventh, and it changed the complexion of the inning. But I thought he pitched as well tonight as he ever has.”Severino absolved Kozma of blame on the error.“Pete Kozma is a great defensive player,” Severino said, adding that he knew Kozma was not trying to make an error. “It’s part of the game.”And Romine scoffed at the notion that he might have let the bunt off the bat of Avisail Garcia, the Sox’ cleanup hitter who is batting .440 with three homers and 13 R.B.I., drop for a possible double play. “If he wants to bunt there, that’s a gift to us,” Romine said. “You take an out where you can get an out.”A version of this article appears in print on April 19, 2017, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: As Yankees’ Strong Offense and Pitching Ends, So Does Their Winning Streak.
