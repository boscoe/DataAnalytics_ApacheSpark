Klein had one year remaining on his contract. His retirement saves the Rangers $2.9 million of salary cap space.Acquired from the Nashville Predators for his fellow defenseman Michael Del Zotto in January 2014, Klein was a key factor for the Rangers as they reached the Stanley Cup finals that spring, when they fell to the Los Angeles Kings.Klein had 22 goals and 50 assists in 224 games with the Rangers. He also skated in 45 playoff games the past four seasons and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference finals in 2015.A second-round draft pick by Nashville in 2003, Klein has 38 goals and 116 assists in 627 career games with the Predators and the Rangers.Klein also had a knack for scoring overtime goals with the Rangers, scoring two during the 2014-15 season against the Devils and Pittsburgh Penguins and another against Detroit in February 2016.“I would like to thank both the Nashville Predators and New York Rangers organizations for giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dream of playing in the N.H.L.,” Klein said in a statement released by the Rangers. “Thank you to the fans of both cities for their appreciation.”Since their season ended with the loss to the Senators in six games, the Rangers have bought out the contract of the veteran defenseman Dan Girardi as well as traded center Derek Stepan and goaltender Antti Raanta to Arizona.The Rangers added the 21-year-old defenseman Anthony DeAngelo in the trade with the Coyotes and signed the free-agent defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to a four-year, $26.6 million contract on July 1. Shattenkirk figures to run the power play from the right side with the captain Ryan McDonagh on the left.Advertisement
