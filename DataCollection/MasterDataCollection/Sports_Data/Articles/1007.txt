Rangers defenseman Kevin Klein announced his retirement on Friday, which made it another veteran departure from the team after a second-round playoff loss to the Ottawa Senators.Klein, 32, was limited to 60 regular-season games and just one playoff contest this season because of back problems. Klein had one year remaining on his contract. His retirement saves the Rangers $2.9 million of salary cap space.Acquired from the Nashville Predators for his fellow defenseman Michael Del Zotto in January 2014, Klein was a key factor for the Rangers as they reached the Stanley Cup finals that spring, when they fell to the Los Angeles Kings.Klein had 22 goals and 50 assists in 224 games with the Rangers. He also skated in 45 playoff games the past four seasons and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference finals in 2015.AdvertisementA second-round draft pick by Nashville in 2003, Klein has 38 goals and 116 assists in 627 career games with the Predators and the Rangers.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Shattenkirk figures to run the power play from the right side with the captain Ryan McDonagh on the left.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
