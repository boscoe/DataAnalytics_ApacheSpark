How can we compete?”Butt, like other athletes, said the future would remain bleak until Pakistan’s government started pouring money into sports.The seven wild-card entries representing Pakistan at next month’s Rio Olympics stand “no chance” of winning medals, said Arif Hasan, the Pakistan Olympic Association president.“They are more or less going for the participation and gaining the experience,” he said. “Let’s hope next time will be better.”Still, those in charge of promoting sports in Pakistan are not very hopeful.The grass-roots system is almost nonexistent, children in schools rarely play any sport other than cricket, and top athletes seldom compete against the world’s best as poorly funded federations cannot afford to send them abroad.Waqar Ahmed, deputy director of the Pakistan Sports Board, said federations also could not afford to hire top coaches familiar with scientific training techniques and ended up relying on Pakistani trainers using obsolete methods from the 1980s.Athletes are frustrated, Ahmed said, because “the coaches are not literate, and they have been teaching what they were taught 30 years back. Without infrastructure, we can do a lot, but without the techniques, you cannot win.”The decline of field hockey, Pakistan’s national sport, has been painful to watch for an older generation who prospered between 1960 and 1994, when Pakistan regularly won Olympic gold medals and world championships.Tahir Zaman, Pakistan’s field hockey coach, said the lack of government support means that many young athletes no longer see a future in the sport, in which top players receive $10 per day. Pakistani cricketers, by contrast, are paid $5,000 monthly retainers and make much more from sponsorship deals.“The attraction is not there anymore,” said Zaman, who won a bronze playing at the 1992 Olympics. The government, he added, “is not offering regular jobs for players.”At Lahore’s empty 45,000-seat field hockey stadium, the player Hassan Anwar, 21, said that when he was a teenager, his family had urged him, “Please don’t play hockey if you want a bright future.”The decline of field hockey has been mirrored by one in the Pakistani squash scene. Young players know all about the 1980s legend Jahangir Khan — considered the greatest squash player ever — but none of them match his bravura on the court.Pakistan’s best-known squash player is Maria Toorpakay Wazir, ranked 65th in the world, but to train she spent years dressing and pretending to be a boy in the ultraconservative tribal areas near Afghanistan. Now she trains abroad.Hasan, Pakistan’s Olympic chief, said that societal barriers for women were “coming down,” but many female athletes lamented the slow pace of change.At 16, Neelam Riaz’s first love was cycling, but her father banned her from training on roads because men would stare at her. In response, she took up karate to learn how to fend off men, and eventually she stumbled onto weight lifting.“Usually in Pakistan, girls are discouraged from sports, and often coaches push back,” said Riaz, 25, who last year became a national champion and Pakistan’s first female weight lifter to compete abroad.“Now my family is happy with me doing weight lifting,” she said.In a dimly lit Lahore gym, where paint peeled off the walls, windows were shattered and cobwebs clung to a damp ceiling, Riaz was tutoring Iqra Chanzaib, 16, who is new to weight lifting.Chanzaib wanted to play basketball, but the only hoop near her house was out in the open and used by boys, so one of her pious brothers protested. She then opted for weight lifting, indoors.“There are plenty of girls like me,” she said, “but they cannot come because of family pressures. My own friends want to come, but their families stop them.”Advertisement
