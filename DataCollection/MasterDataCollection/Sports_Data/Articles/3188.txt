Jason Servis watched with pride when John, his brother and fellow thoroughbred trainer, sent Smarty Jones to victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in 2004. But his joy turned to sadness when the long-shot Birdstone upset Smarty Jones’s Triple Crown bid by one length in the Belmont Stakes. Sadness turned to dismay when the colt never ran again.Smarty Jones was retired less than two months after his lone defeat closed a brilliant but fleeting nine-race career. The colt was said to have “chronic bruising of the bottom of the cannon bone in all four fetlock joints.”That wrenching swing of emotions stays with Jason Servis as he prepares to run Sunny Ridge on Saturday at Aqueduct Racetrack in the Gotham Stakes, a significant Kentucky Derby prep race on the New York circuit. Sunny Ridge prevailed by three-quarters of a length in the Withers Stakes, the previous prep at Aqueduct. He ranks eighth with 18 points in the system used by Churchill Downs to determine a Derby field capped at 20 starters.Yet Sunny Ridge’s greatest obstacle to reaching the crowded Derby starting gate on May 7 may be Servis and Dennis Drazin, his breeder and owner. Although they emphasize that their plan can change, their uncommon strategy calls for them to skip the Derby in order to target the Preakness, the middle leg of the Triple Crown, and the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J., on July 31.Advertisement“I know from my experience,” Servis said, “if I am not careful, I won’t have a horse left.”Drazin is a lawyer who has a long association with racing’s uphill battle in his home state of New Jersey. He supports Servis’s desire to take a long view with a horse that is without breeding value because he is a gelded New Jersey-bred. “If I had Derby fever,” Drazin said, “it would be only for my ego and not looking at the right thing to do.”AdvertisementSunny Ridge, sired by the 1994 Horse of the Year, Holy Bull, gained prominence when he won the Sapling Stakes by two and a quarter lengths at Monmouth in September. He stamped himself as a Derby prospect with strong efforts over wet surfaces when he placed second to Greenpointcrusader in the Grade I Champagne Stakes in October at Belmont Park and missed overtaking the well regarded Exaggerator by a neck in the Delta Downs Jackpot on Nov. 21 in Vinton, La.Sunny Ridge produced a polished effort on a fast track at Aqueduct when the gray-roan gelding made his 3-year-old debut in the Withers and easily dispatched Vorticity by three-quarters of a length for jockey Manuel Franco. As impressive as that performance was, Servis and Drazin are keenly aware of the undefeated 3-year-olds Nyquist and Mohaymen.“I don’t know if he’s Nyquist,” Servis said of Sunny Ridge. “I don’t know if he’s that type.”Nyquist, winner of the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and the 2-year-old champion, extended his record to 6 for 6 when he fended off Exaggerator by one and a half lengths in the Grade II San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita Park on Feb. 15 in the first of two scheduled Derby preps for the West Coast star. Mohaymen, rated the top 3-year-old in the East, swept Florida’s first two preps with rousing victories in the Holy Bull Stakes and the Fountain of Youth Stakes to make him 5 for 5.

For many owners and breeders, the Derby dream is limited to having a horse good enough to start in the signature race on the first Saturday in May. Not Drazin.“The average person on the street seems to judge you by ‘Did you have a horse run in the Derby?’ That’s important to everybody else, but it’s not that important to me,” Drazin said. “I don’t want to put a horse in the Derby who I don’t think will win it, even though he could probably hit the board.”AdvertisementDrazin, who was born in Rumson, N.J., is a former chairman of the New Jersey Racing Commission. He is a top adviser to the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association, which leases Monmouth Park.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He gained much of his knowledge from being on the backs of sore horses and has built a reputation for turning around problematic thoroughbreds. He sent Tightend Touchdown, a horse he claimed for $35,000, to a runner-up finish in the 2013 Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint, his most significant result.He believes a key to success is his willingness to provide his horses with ample time between starts, a philosophy counter to the Triple Crown’s grind of three races in five weeks.Speaking about his brother, John Servis said: “He’s all about the horse, and he thinks longevity-wise. If he can have a super horse for the next few years, the Derby is not going to be on his bucket list.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
