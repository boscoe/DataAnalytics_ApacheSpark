Europe wants at least 16 places at the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup finals, Aleksander Ceferin, the president of UEFA, the European soccer organization, said Thursday.The sport’s governing body, FIFA, decided last month to add 16 teams at the finals, with a first round of 16 groups of three. The top two in each group would qualify for the knockout stage.Besides the 16 slots, Ceferin said that UEFA would ask that each European team be placed in a different group. “Then if it’s true that we are so good, that the quality is on our side, then I think that all 16 can qualify in the second round,” he told a news conference after a UEFA executive committee meeting in Nyon, Switzerland.
