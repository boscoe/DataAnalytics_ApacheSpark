For the first 45 minutes of their second-round series opener, the Edmonton Oilers showed they can match the Anaheim Ducks in a tight-checking, low-scoring grind of a playoff hockey game.When things got wild and frantic in the final minutes, the upstart Oilers showed they can hang with the best in the West in that sort of game, too.Adam Larsson scored his second goal of the third period with 4 minutes 40 seconds to play, and the visiting Oilers blew a two-goal lead in a wild third period before beating the Anaheim Ducks, 5-3, on Wednesday night in their second-round playoff series opener.Mark Letestu scored two power-play goals and Cam Talbot made 33 saves for the Oilers, who seized home-ice advantage from the Ducks with a four-goal final period.AdvertisementLarsson, acquired by Edmonton in the trade of the former No. 1 draft pick Taylor Hall to the Devils, scored just four goals in his first 85 games this season, but he improbably got two goals in seven and a half minutes.Advertisement“It’s really nice to see him get rewarded and get a couple of goals,” Letestu said. “That’s not normally what he does for us.”The Ducks lost in regulation for the first time in 19 games since March 10.

The puck banked off Anaheim defenseman Josh Manson’s skate and pinballed underneath John Gibson, who stopped 27 shots.PREDATORS 4, BLUES 3 P.K. Subban had a goal and two assists and Vernon Fiddler scored with 5:05 left, sending Nashville to the road win in Game 1 of its second-round playoff series.The Predators lost Kevin Fiala to an ugly leg injury in the second period and blew a 3-1 lead before Fiddler poked a loose puck by Jake Allen in the third. It was the fifth career playoff goal for the 36-year-old Fiddler, who did not play in Nashville’s first-round sweep of Chicago.Advertisement“He’s a veteran guy so he’s been in these situations before and he stepped up and got us a big goal,” Subban said. “That was the toughest game of the season for us and they fought so hard and had so many chances, but we found a way to get it done.”Colin Wilson and Filip Forsberg also scored for Nashville, and Pekka Rinne made 27 saves.Colton Parayko, Jaden Schwartz and Vladimir Sobotka scored for St. Louis. Allen finished with 28 stops, but lamented the one he did not make. He tried to poke check the puck away from Fiddler and instead it ended up getting past him.“Guys fought back great,” Allen said. “A little mistake by me cost us.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
