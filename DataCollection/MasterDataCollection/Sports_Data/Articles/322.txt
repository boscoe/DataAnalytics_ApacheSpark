FRISCO, Tex. — Jerry Jones does not do small. He took the money-losing Dallas Cowboys and turned them into the most valuable team in America. He built AT&T Stadium, the biggest venue in the N.F.L. With the help of lucrative licensing and sponsorship deals, the Cowboys generated $620 million last year, the highest revenue in the league, according to Forbes.Now Blue Star Land, a real estate development company owned by the Jones family, is building what will be the largest team headquarters in the league. For the past two years, Jones and his children, Stephen, Charlotte and Jerry Jones Jr., have overseen the construction of Ford Center at the Star in Frisco, a sprawling complex that will include the team’s training facility and offices in a retail and entertainment district about 20 miles north of the team’s current headquarters in Irving.Sitting on 91 acres in this fast-growing suburb, the Star will include 510,000 square feet for the team’s offices and training facilities and a 12,000-seat indoor stadium that will be shared with the eight high schools in Frisco. The Cowboys will also have two outdoor practice fields.To bring high-end fans closer to the team, Jones is adding the Cowboys Club at the Star, a members-only club with a dining room that overlooks the outdoor practice fields. Cowboys Fit at the Star, a gym, will allow members to train near the players and Cowboys cheerleaders. Legends, the hospitality business owned jointly by the Cowboys and the Yankees, will book events.AdvertisementAll of this will be surrounded by a 16-floor, 300-room Omni hotel and conference center; a 200,000-square-foot medical center; another 200,000 square feet of shops; and 400,000 square feet of office space. Along with parking, plazas and jogging trails, the project will fill about 60 acres; the Jones family has an option to build on the remaining land.“This is not your traditional real estate project, but we have booming growth, a prime location and a sound business plan to hook up with amateur sports,” Jones said as he circled the construction site in a helicopter. “You have to have the juice to make it operate.”AdvertisementJones said the project had been a welcome diversion for him and the Cowboys, who just completed a season to forget. Undone by injuries and inconsistent play, the team won just four games. The Cowboys’ final record was their worst since 1989.Teams have been wringing more money out of their training facilities in recent years. They have sold naming rights for their buildings and tickets to fans wanting to watch players train. Food, T-shirts and other merchandise are for sale at practices.The size and scope of the project in Frisco are more ambitious. The project includes $115 million from the city of Frisco, which sold about two-thirds of the land to the Cowboys and leases the rest to them. Of that amount, the Frisco Independent School District is contributing $30 million toward the stadium, with city-related agencies adding $60 million, some of which is paid for with a 1-cent local sales tax. The city is also contributing $25 million toward building the team’s headquarters.“The Cowboys knew what they needed, and we knew what we could provide,” said Maher Maso, the mayor of Frisco. “It wasn’t Jerry Jones saying, ‘I need more money.’ You hear about teams trying to take cities to the cleaners.”

The school district, which has grown rapidly to meet an influx of new residents, wanted to build a new stadium anyway. Now its athletes will rub shoulders with pro players, and the Cowboys will pay for stadium maintenance.The city considers its investment in the project a bargain because it drew a brand-name tenant in the Cowboys and the Jones family, which has committed more than $500 million to the project so far and attracted other investors as well. It will also cement the city’s reputation as a sports destination.AdvertisementWhen the Cowboys move to Frisco this summer, every major pro sports team in the Dallas area will have a presence in Frisco, a city of about 150,000. The Cowboys will join the Frisco RoughRiders, a Class AA affiliate of the Texas Rangers; the Texas Legends, an N.B.A. Development League team linked to the Mavericks; the Dallas Stars of the N.H.L., who train in the city; and F.C. Dallas of M.L.S.F.C. Dallas provided a blueprint for the Cowboys. A decade ago, the city, in partnership with the team, the county and the school district, built a stadium and 17 practice fields that F.C. Dallas and the local community share. The team received a subsidized stadium and practice complex, while the city and the county obtained access to professional-grade fields for their students and residents.“They’ve been very, very aggressive, and it’s worked out for them very well,” said Clark Hunt, whose family owns the Kansas City Chiefs and F.C. Dallas. “In a region as big as Dallas-Fort Worth, to have all five of the major sports teams in their community says a lot about their vision.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Charlotte Jones, who oversees the day-to-day details of the project, views the Star as a way to let fans get closer to the team while leveraging the team’s popularity.By sharing a stadium with the school district, the Cowboys will guarantee that many residents will shop, eat and work out at the Star. With office space above the Cowboys’ team headquarters, workers will eat and shop there, too. The hotel, convention space and medical center will attract more visitors. The Cowboys have reached deals with sponsors, including Ford, PepsiCo, Dr Pepper, Nike and Lincoln, to raise additional revenue.“This will allow people to get a peek under the helmet,” Charlotte Jones said. “We want to maximize fan engagement, to get the touch and feel of the team before they reach their seat.”The Star has not gone unnoticed in league circles. Several teams have inquired about the project, including the St. Louis Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke, who has proposed moving his team to Los Angeles.Whether they can replicate what the Cowboys are doing is unclear. In Texas, where football is king, school districts are more willing to build 12,000-seat stadiums. Few cities have grown as fast as Frisco, which has doubled in the past decade. And few teams can attract as many big corporate sponsors and big spenders, whether they like the Cowboys or not.“People either love us or hate us, but the most important thing is to be relevant,” Jerry Jones said. “It’s not enough to just build a building, put a sign up and open the door.”A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2016, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Cowboys’ Star on the Rise in a Dallas Suburb.
