Joe Johnson’s home debut on Tuesday night in Miami was part of the best shooting effort in Heat history.And he is part of a winning streak for the first time in nearly three months.The Heat set a franchise record by shooting 67.5 percent from the floor, established a season high for points and beat the Chicago Bulls, 129-111. Hassan Whiteside scored a career-high 26 points and had 14 rebounds for the Heat, while Johnson scored 24 points in the first time he had played in back-to-back wins since Dec. 8-10 with the Nets.Johnson was bought out by the Nets last week, cleared waivers Saturday and signed with the Heat not long after.No team had shot better in an N.B.A. game this season than the 61.8 percent posted by San Antonio against Philadelphia on Dec. 7. The Heat topped that easily, with Deng, Whiteside and Johnson combining to shoot 26 for 34.AdvertisementChicago was within 108-102 with 5 minutes 14 seconds left before Miami finished on a 21-9 run. Wade set up Whiteside with an alley-oop lob with 2:53 left that increased the Heat’s lead to 121-106 after a free throw, and the only question left was how many records Miami would set.AdvertisementDerrick Rose returned from a three-game absence because of injury and scored 17 points for Chicago, which lost for the 17th time in 25 games and fell to the No. 9 spot in the Eastern Conference race. Pau Gasol had 15 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists, and Taj Gibson added 13 points for Chicago — but left in the third quarter with a right hamstring injury.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
