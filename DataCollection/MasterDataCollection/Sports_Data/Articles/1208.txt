Generations of Latin Americans in particular have traded their skills for the money and kudos of top European clubs — but what has changed is the intensity of the friendship of the Barcelona three, and right now the expectation that they try to shoot one another down.South America doesn’t just play friendly national team games in March. The 10 countries are reaching the midpoint of their prolonged qualification for the 2018 World Cup, and the soccer giants Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay are getting as hungry as lions scavenging for points toward that process.For Neymar and for Suárez, it gets immediately more personal.Neymar is expected to lead Brazil against Uruguay on Thursday in Recife, Brazil, and to shine despite the fact that he has just been convicted of tax fraud and fined more than $52 million by a Brazilian court.Suárez, his buddy in Barcelona, has quite a debt to pay to his own country. Thursday will be his first opportunity to play again for Uruguay since he was banned for nine national team games after his notorious bite on the shoulder of Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup tournament — in Brazil.So both Neymar and Suárez are looking for redemption. They shared the long flight from northern Spain to northern Brazil, and they share with Messi the chase to try to repeat this season what they achieved last — winning the Spanish league, Spanish Cup, Champions League and Club World Cup.It is a long way from relatively balmy Barcelona to the tropical heat of the Arena Pernambuco in Recife. The ball is still round, the rules are unchanged, but Neymar and Suárez will have no Andrés Iniesta or Messi to help set up their chances of scoring.Messi, indeed, has another familiar foe to face in Chile’s national stadium in Santiago on Thursday. He comes up against his own club goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo.Messi firing on Bravo is only part of the situation. It is a repeat performance, because, last July, Argentina lost in the same stadium to Chile in the final of the Copa América, which the host, Chile, won on a penalty shootout, 4-1.The game itself had finished scoreless. Bravo kept out everything that Messi or anyone shot at him, though Messi was the only Argentine who managed to beat the keeper from the penalty spot.They are comrades in a common cause for 10 months of the year, but opponents in these two huge competitions, the World Cup and the Copa. And they must do it all again this summer because there is an extra Copa América, marking the centenary of the event, to be staged in the United States.The expectation on Messi has grown because, through no fault of his own, he missed the first four games of World Cup qualifying last year. Messi was injured, and even with all its firepower — Sergio Agüero, Ángel Di María, Gonzalo Higuaín, Ezequiel Lavezzi and the youngsters Ángel Correa and Paulo Dybala — Argentina without Messi is apparently an impotent force.Even Messi doesn’t look like the world’s best player on national team duty the way he does week in, week out for Barça. But he helped Argentina to the finals of both the World Cup and the Copa in the past two years, and in his absence, the country has managed only one win, and only two goals, in four South America qualifying matches for the next World Cup.It is almost as if the bigger the stars get in Europe, the more their countries fixate upon them. Where you would expect the coaches, Dunga for Brazil and Gerardo Martino for Argentina, to organize from the abundant talents, with or without the superstars, it seems morale subsides when the leaders are missing.Agüero, the Manchester City forward who is viewed by many in Europe to be the second best Argentine striker of this era, spoke on his arrival back home in Buenos Aires of the sheer relief the players all feel that Messi is available to captain them again.How strange this dependency on a single player seems, given that all three leading South American lands provide players who are big names, dependable and so creative for clubs in Spain, France, Germany, Italy and England.It is almost as if they diminish, rather than grow, on home soil. In one sense, they are no longer acclimatized to playing in their homelands. Neymar and Willian and Douglas Costa can be absolutely outstanding most weeks for Barcelona, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, but put them in Recife, where the air temperature and the humidity might be three times as high as where they play most of their soccer, and it is as if they are in alien territory.In part, this is because the other South American teams are so good, and so competitive in World Cup qualifying rounds.Ecuador, for example, currently leads the standings, with four wins in four games — and players like Antonio Valencia (Manchester United) and Enner Valencia (West Ham United) become emboldened by their trips home.Advertisement
