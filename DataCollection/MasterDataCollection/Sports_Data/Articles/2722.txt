When the Pittsburgh Penguins visited the Rangers at Madison Square Garden on Friday, both playoff-bound teams were primarily trying to stay healthy and iron out lineup kinks with just over a week left in the regular season.The Penguins, the defending Stanley Cup champions, played without many key members. Forward Evgeni Malkin, the former Ranger speedster Carl Hagelin and defensemen Kris Letang and Olli Maatta all missed the contest with various ailments.Add in the facts that the Penguins had lost four straight and the Rangers have lately been hard-pressed to win at home, and the game did not appear to have the makings of a scintillating matchup.But thrilling drama unfolded nonetheless. After the Rangers tied the contest at 19 minutes 48 seconds of the third period on a goal by Chris Kreider — and after a compelling overtime with excellent chances for both squads — the Penguins left with a 4-3 win, courtesy of shootout goals by Phil Kessel and Sidney Crosby.AdvertisementThe thin roster did not detract from a mostly strong performance by the Penguins, who demolished the Rangers, 6-1, in their most recent visit to the Garden on Nov. 23 and also routed the Rangers, 7-2, in Pittsburgh in late December.AdvertisementThis time, goals by the rookie forward Jake Guentzel, Crosby and Bryan Rust supported Matt Murray’s 30 saves as the Penguins improved to 47-19-11 and the Rangers (46-26-6) failed to win for the eighth straight time at home.Nick Holden and Rick Nash also scored for the Rangers, who scratched their captain Ryan McDonagh for a reason that Coach Alain Vigneault said was “nothing serious” as the team returned from a three-game swing through California.The Rangers lost the last two games of the trip but still clinched a playoff spot for the 11th time in 12 seasons.But the Rangers have an odd way of getting into a playoff groove. Aside from a 3-0 win at Los Angeles to start their Western swing, their play has been haphazard and lacking urgency in recent weeks.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As the presumed first wild-card team, their likely first-round opponent will be the Montreal Canadiens, leaders of the Atlantic Division.“We are trying to play the right way with and without the puck,” Vigneault said Friday morning. “You want to make sure your execution is where you want it to be.”The Rangers were sharp only for spurts against the Penguins, who secured a winning road record for the 11th straight season.AdvertisementAfter allowing five goals in losses at Anaheim and San Jose, Henrik Lundqvist was sharp in the first period against the Penguins, against whom he was making his 61st regular-season start, the most of any opponent for the Rangers’ 35-year-old goaltender.He stopped all 15 shots in the opening period, denying Chris Kunitz four times, Crosby three times and defenseman Mark Streit from in close.But 39 seconds into the second, Guentzel tapped in a pass from Crosby for his 12th goal of the season, and the momentum shifted to Pittsburgh.The Rangers — who have not won on home ice since a 2-1 victory over Washington on Feb. 19 — were outmuscled and outplayed by the Penguins before Crosby added his league-leading 43rd goal from a nearly impossible angle at 10:46 of the second. Crosby, from the corner to Lundqvist’s right, banked the puck off the goaltender to give the Penguins a two-goal margin.Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, who guided the team to the Stanley Cup after taking over before Christmas last season, spoke before the game of his team’s need to return to the style that has carried them to another 100-point season, their sixth in eight seasons.“We want to be in the best frame of mind to give ourselves a chance to win,” he said.Even though they required a shootout, it was mission accomplished for the Penguins.SLAP SHOTSThe Rangers host the Penguins in their season finale on April 9.A version of this article appears in print on April 1, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Two Playoff-Bound Teams Stage a Game Worthy of the Postseason.
