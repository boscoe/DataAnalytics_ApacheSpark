Originally tied to conduct by academic counselors, the charge now focuses on two former staff members while also citing them for violating “principles of ethical conduct.”While noting that many at-risk athletes had used “anomalous” courses to help maintain academic eligibility, the most recent notice restores a reference to players on the football and men’s basketball teams among that group. That reference was removed before the second version of the allegations was filed in April.North Carolina has faced five top-level charges in all three versions, including lack of institutional control. Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham said in a conference call that the university had “serious concerns” about a process that he said had “gotten off track” in a case tied to North Carolina’s long-running academic fraud scandal.“I have never seen three notices on the same case,” Cunningham said. He later added, “To have such a moving target is confounding to me.”PRINCETON CANCELS REMAINDER OF A SEASON Princeton has canceled the rest of the men’s swimming and diving season after university administrators discovered that team members had posted “vulgar and offensive” material on their electronic mailing list.The university announced that Athletic Director Mollie Marcoux Samaan had told the team that it would not compete in meets scheduled against Navy on Jan. 7 and Harvard and Yale on Feb. 5. It also will not compete in the Ivy League championship in February.The team was suspended last week after university officials received an anonymous complaint about the electronic correspondence. A statement released by Princeton did not disclose specifics but said that the “misogynistic and racist” comments involved the women’s swimming and diving team.Georgia has fined an assistant coach, Shane Beamer, $25,000 for accepting leaked game plan information from a former Wake Forest assistant two years ago while Beamer was at Virginia Tech.In a statement issued by Georgia, Beamer said that Tommy Elrod, then a radio broadcaster for Wake Forest games, had called him the night before the game in 2014 with “a few plays that he said Wake Forest might run.”Beamer — the son of Frank Beamer, the Hokies’ retired coach — said he had not shared the plays with anyone and had not used the information in the game, which the Demon Deacons won, 6-3, in double overtime.The younger Beamer said he had “made a serious mistake in judgment by accepting the information and failing to notify” Virginia Tech officials.Elrod, who coached on Wake Forest’s staff for 11 years, has been fired from his position as the Demon Deacons’ radio analyst.Russia will not hold biathlon and speedskating events it was scheduled to host this winter, a result of allegations that it had run a state-sponsored doping scheme.The final report from the World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren has prompted Western athletes to campaign for boycotts of several winter sports in Russia after 12 Russian medalists from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were implicated.The International Biathlon Union said it had provisionally suspended two Russian athletes, who are the subjects of doping cases from Sochi that have been opened by the International Olympic Committee. The two were not identified by the biathlon union.Russia won four medals in biathlon at Sochi, including gold in the men’s team relay. The biathlon union said it was investigating 29 other Russian biathletes, based on McLaren’s evidence, but they are currently free to continue competing.Russian biathlon officials gave up their rights to host a World Cup round at Tyumen in March and the world junior championships, which were to start in Ostrov in late February. It would be “impossible” to hold the events in the circumstances, the Russian Biathlon Union said.The International Skating Union said it was stripping the Russian city of Chelyabinsk of the final round of this season’s speedskating World Cup because, after McLaren’s report, “the focus of the event would not be on the sport but rather accusations and controversies.”Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway edged Marcel Hirscher of Austria in a World Cup men’s slalom in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy. Kristoffersen finished the two runs 0.33 of a second faster than Hirscher, the five-time defending overall World Cup champion.The second-division team Alcorcón eliminated the top-tier squad Espanyol from Spain’s Copa del Rey with a 4-3 victory in a penalty shootout.Gerardo Moreno and José Manuel Jurado missed penalty kicks for Espanyol.
