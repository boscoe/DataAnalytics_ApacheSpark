Tom Brady will try to prevent the Buffalo Bills from securing a season sweep over the New England Patriots. Later Sunday, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Atlanta Falcons’ Matt Ryan will face off in what could be an epic shootout. But those veterans are merely a warm-up for the prime-time clash of two exciting rookie quarterbacks in a game with N.F.C. East implications:8:30 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 4 ½In the fourth round of this year’s draft, 133 picks after the Philadelphia Eagles selected Carson Wentz, the Dallas Cowboys rolled the dice on Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott with plans to develop him as Tony Romo’s backup. While Wentz has drawn praise for his surprisingly fast start, Prescott has been mentioned as a dark-horse candidate for the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award.Prescott, technically, is still just keeping Romo’s seat warm. The Cowboys have indicated on several occasions that Romo has not lost his starting job while injured, and Prescott, with his 5-1 record and sterling passer rating of 103.9, could end up carrying a clipboard.The quarterback controversy remains on ice because Romo has yet to be medically cleared to play. But if Prescott follows the Cowboys’ Week 6 win at Green Bay by beating a formidable division rival, the thought of going back to Romo will seem ridiculous.For as good as Romo has been, he is a fragile, highly paid 36-year-old who has played only four games over the last two seasons. Prescott, 23, recovered from a loss in Week 1 to reel off five consecutive wins while making almost no mistakes. Behind him and running back Ezekiel Elliott, the No. 4 pick in the draft, the Cowboys’ offense is more entertaining than it has been in years.AdvertisementPrescott will be tested against a Philadelphia defense that has been reimagined by Jim Schwartz into the type of unit that offenses hate to face. The Eagles are third in the N.F.L. in points allowed a game and fifth in total yards. In unwelcome news for Prescott, they have 20 sacks.AdvertisementIf Prescott, under the pressure of a prime-time matchup against a good defense, finally proves to be human, it will make it easier for Dallas to stick with the plan of bringing back Romo. But if the hot streak continues — a possibility heightened by Dez Bryant’s expected return — Romo could end up in a situation similar to Alex Smith’s situation with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. That year, an injury paved the way for Colin Kaepernick to start, and San Francisco stuck with him all the way through the Super Bowl, with a healthy Smith watching from the sideline.Pick: Cowboys1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 6 ½ If you look at the raw totals, the Patriots and the Bills seem fairly similar in scoring, points allowed, total offense and total defense. But those figures include the four games New England played without Tom Brady. The Patriots have hit a different gear since their star quarterback returned from a suspension.With Brady this season, the Patriots have averaged 31.7 points a game, and he has looked better than ever, completing 75 percent of his passes to a diverse group of receivers. Julian Edelman has caught anything thrown near him in the short game, Chris Hogan serves as a respectable deep threat, and Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett have exploited their size and speed advantages.Buffalo relies on its running game and its defense to win games, with Tyrod Taylor passing for more than 250 yards just once this season. That formula works most weeks, but it is not enough to keep up with the Patriots’ offensive juggernaut.Pick: Patriots
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard scoring formats and will be updated each week.            4:25 p.m. Line: Falcons by 3Two teams with good quarterbacks, questionable running games and bad secondaries could result in a wild game of throwing the ball up and seeing what happens. In the past, that might have favored Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but other than in last week’s easy win over the struggling Chicago Bears, he has not looked nearly as polished this season as Atlanta’s Matt Ryan.Ryan leads the N.F.L. with 2,348 passing yards and has averaged a remarkable 9.6 yards an attempt, by far his career high. Rodgers is averaging 6.3 yards an attempt, his lowest average since he became the team’s starter in 2008.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The most notable feature is that the 1-5 team is favored, a shocker even if it is a home game. That says a lot about how inconsistent Arizona has been and how fluky people consider Carolina’s awful start to be. Arizona’s defense is one of the best, and it will have quite a task in trying to slow Cam Newton and the Carolina offense. Whichever team wins, it is just a single step on the long road to fixing a bad season. The losing team may need to start looking forward to the off-season.Pick: Cardinals4:05 p.m. Line: Broncos by 5 ½Denver remembered how to run the ball last week: C. J. Anderson helped lead the way in an easy win over Houston. Unfortunately, Anderson also sustained a knee injury that could keep him out for several weeks, which leaves the rookie Devontae Booker to carry the load. Provided Denver’s defense plays better than it did in a loss to San Diego two weeks ago, the drop-off from Anderson to Booker should not affect the outcome.AdvertisementPick: Broncos1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 1 ½For a team that is looking to move to Las Vegas, the Raiders are preparing well for life away from Oakland by fashioning themselves into road warriors. Four of the team’s five wins have come on the road, and the Raiders are just two short of matching the franchise record for road wins. Strangely enough, they have done this without much help from their defense, a terrible group that will have its hands full trying to stop wide receiver Mike Evans, who has blossomed into the touchdown machine that many expected after his strong career at Texas A&M.Pick: Raiders1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 2 ½At 33, Colts running back Frank Gore is in the twilight of his career, but he is still productive and again in the top 10 in the N.F.L. in rushing yards, with 495. He has passed Thurman Thomas, Franco Harris, Marcus Allen, Edgerrin James, Marshall Faulk and Jim Brown on his way to being ninth on the career rushing list. Next up is Tony Dorsett, and while Gore probably cannot get the 204 yards he needs to catch him this week — no Colts running back has broken 200 yards since James in 2004 — he can still play a big part in a Colts upset.Pick: Colts1 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 2 ½Seattle seemed to take a major step back last week, with the team’s offense looking incompetent in a 6-6 tie with Arizona. The New Orleans defense is a lot easier to score on than the Cardinals’, but with his style of play seemingly affected by various issues this season, Russell Wilson will have to find a way to rekindle his previous success if he wants to outscore Drew Brees.Pick: Seahawks1 p.m. Line: Texans by 2 ½Matthew Stafford has been getting a great deal of praise for leading the Lions to three consecutive wins, but each was a nail-biter in which he received plenty of help when the opposing team fell apart. Stafford deserves credit for taking advantage, and if he can get more support from the running game — which should not be a problem against Houston — he may get a road win without quite as much drama.Pick: Lions1 p.m. Line: Jets by 3It is expected to be chilly and rainy, the Browns have not won a game this season, and with Cody Kessler working his way back from a concussion, Cleveland is likely to start either Josh McCown or Kevin Hogan at quarterback. Add all of that to Cleveland fans’ being distracted by preparations for Game 5 of the World Series, and this could be one of the least-watched N.F.L. games in memory.Pick: JetsTimes are Eastern.
