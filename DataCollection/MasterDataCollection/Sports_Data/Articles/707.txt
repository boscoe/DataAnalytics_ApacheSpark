TAMPA, Fla. —  Early last week, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi was asked about the three-way fight to be catcher Brian McCann’s backup.The candidates were distinct in age, experience and perceived potential. The youngest of the three, Gary Sanchez, 23, was viewed as a future starter, and he had good offensive numbers in 2015, hitting 18 homers and batting .274 while splitting time between Class AA Trenton and Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. This spring, however, Sanchez has barely reached base.Then there was Austin Romine, a second-round pick by the Yankees in 2007. Since then, Romine, 27, has played 77 games for the Yankees with a .201 batting average. He spent most of 2015 in Class AAA, hitting .260 with 7 homers.And finally, there was 32-year-old Carlos Corporan, a journeyman who has played part of six seasons in the major leagues, with three teams, accumulating 701 at-bats, a .218 career average and 20 home runs. In 2015, he played 33 games for the Texas Rangers, batting .178. “They’ve all played hard,” Girardi said. “They’ve all caught the ball well.”AdvertisementGirardi added that in trying to figure out who would be McCann’s backup, “I kind of went in with an open mind.”Advertisement“I think that’s important to do so that you don’t get locked into what you’re thinking and maybe overlook things,” Girardi said.That was Tuesday. Two days later, Girardi narrowed the battle, opting to send Sanchez back to Class AAA for more seasoning. Sanchez had given Girardi little choice, going 1 for 21 this spring (an .048 average) and making it clear to Girardi that he was trying too hard to make the Yankees’ opening day roster.This was not something that Girardi said he could overlook.“It’s not the first time we’ve seen players maybe press a little bit,” Girardi told reporters after the move was announced, noting that it often happened when a young player had an opportunity to make a major league roster for the first time.Before Sanchez was told he was going back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, he had expressed confidence that he would begin getting hits before March was over and would make a case for himself to go north with the rest of the major league crew.

But I think it will come. It always does.”But not in the Bronx, at least for a while.As for Romine, whose numbers this spring — 6 for 22, .273 average, 4 doubles — have been a lot healthier than Sanchez’s, he now seems the clear favorite to emerge as the No. 2 catcher one year after he was beaten out for that spot by John Ryan Murphy. Murphy was traded to the Minnesota Twins in the off-season for outfielder Aaron Hicks.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As did Jorge Posada.AdvertisementCorporan, like Posada, is from Puerto Rico, but he has no Yankee lineage. He was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers after being selected in the 12th round of the 2003 draft, made it to the majors six years later, going 1 for 1 as a Brewer (easier said than done) and then moving to the Houston Astros before becoming a Texas Ranger. His minor league résumé is extensive and almost exhausting to read. He has played in a lot of places.Corporan was also confident enough last week to make a case for himself on the major league level, where he is hitting .174 this spring.“My numbers don’t show how good or bad I’ve been doing, what I’ve been giving to the team,” he said. “I know what I can do in the big leagues. I’m a guy who will perform, who will hit the ball when the skipper needs the starting catcher to take the day off.“I know I can do the job,” he added. “I’ve proven to people I can be a good backup, so I’m not worried about my numbers in the spring because it’s a completely different situation than the season.”McCann, the incumbent, is 32. The wear and tear of being an everyday major league catcher is no doubt taking its toll. He started 119 games behind the plate last season (1,224 over all in his 11-year career), and the Yankees will probably look to give him a decent number of days off from catching this season.The backup, whoever it may be, will be busy.A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2016, on Page SP5 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Pare a Crowd Behind the Plate.
