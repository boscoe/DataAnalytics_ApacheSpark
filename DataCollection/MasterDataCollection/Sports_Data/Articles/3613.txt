Afterward, he blamed bed bugs for knocking him out of the Cavaliers’ victory over the Thunder on Sunday.Irving played just nine minutes in that game because, he said, he was "freaked out" and tired after he was bitten on the head by bed bugs. The Cavaliers stayed in a hotel in Oklahoma City on Saturday night.The team had said Irving was bothered by flulike symptoms, but he said he had gotten only three hours’ sleep after he saw five bugs on his pillow. He spent the rest of the night on a couch in his room. Irving said he felt better Monday.Before the game, Detroit rescinded a three-player, three-team trade with the Houston Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers, negating it because not all the players involved had been cleared medically.Houston had traded guard Marcus Thornton and the big man Donatas Motiejunas to Detroit last week for center Joel Anthony and a protected first-round draft pick this year. The Rockets also made the move to acquire the draft rights of the Nigerian forward Chukwudiebere Maduabum from Philadelphia.Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy, who also serves as the team’s president, said he regretted that the deal had to be scrapped.“It’s disappointing because we saw the possibilities with Donatas,” he said.Because of privacy concerns, the Pistons did not specify any medical information. Van Gundy said Anthony would rejoin the Pistons for Wednesday’s home game against the 76ers.
