Iranian women reported that they were being barred from attending a major volleyball tournament featuring the Olympic-bound men’s national team, reigniting a debate about whether Iran should be allowed to host international matches.After a commitment from volleyball’s world governing body that women would be able to attend this weekend’s World League tournament at the Azadi Sport Complex in Tehran, Iranian women who have pushed to make sporting events more open say they have not been able to buy tickets online despite repeated efforts.Female fans are traditionally barred from attending male-only sports events in Iran as a result of efforts by the authorities to enforce strict interpretations of Islamic norms, but many women are pushing to change that practice.The international volleyball federation, known as the FIVB, an abbreviation for its French name, streamed the Argentina-Italy and Iran-Serbia matches Friday, showing a section of women in the stands. It was unclear whether the women were invited guests or members of the public. A female announcer handled substitutions during Iran’s match.AdvertisementThe FIVB released a statement noting that the Iranian federation had said that Friday’s matches sold out within five minutes and that 466 of the 5,000 tickets had been allotted for a section set aside for women. The area of seats, shown repeatedly on the live stream, did not appear that large.AdvertisementFrom the moment tickets became available, the sales website said that the female allotment had been filled, according to several women who said they had tried to purchase tickets.“Honestly, when I saw their statement, I said, If FIVB were Pinocchio, their nose was from Lausanne to Tehran,” said a 32-year-old Iranian woman who represents a group called Open Stadiums. “Why they lie this much?” She declined to give her name out of fear of retaliation. The Open Stadiums Twitter account identifies itself as “A movement of Iranian Women seeking to end discrimination and let women attend stadiums.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The sport’s profile is rising in the country, tied to the national team’s success.Eighth-ranked Iran qualified for its first Olympic tournament as one of the 12 teams set to play in Rio de Janeiro this August.“It is important to emphasize that this is a first step of a long-term campaign to reinstate female spectators at volleyball events in Iran and one which the FIVB is 100 percent committed to,” the FIVB said in a statement. “Our policy is one of engagement and diplomacy to secure inclusion through sport not through the threat of isolation. While we understand that volleyball alone can’t enforce change, we appreciate that we have a significant platform for creating dialogue and the FIVB will continue to strive for sport’s power as an agent for positive change to be fully realized.”For a February beach volleyball event at Iran’s Kish Island, women were not allowed to watch the tournament, and the FIVB said that “misunderstandings” were at the root of the issue. Women were later allowed to watch matches from a cafe overlooking the main court.AdvertisementThe issue first drew international attention in June 2014, when a British-Iranian student, Ghoncheh Ghavami, was detained when she tried to attend a men’s volleyball match at Azadi. She spent more than 100 days in prison, much of it in solitary confinement.The case prompted the FIVB president, Ary Graca, to urge Iranian officials to release her. He told the volleyball federations at the end of their world congress: “We never normally seek to interfere with the laws of any country. But in accordance with the Olympic Charter, the FIVB is committed to inclusivity and the right of women to participate in sport on an equal basis.”Also, in November 2014, FIVB said that in light of Ghavami’s imprisonment, Iran would not be chosen to host a boys’ under-19 world championship. Ghavami was sentenced to a year in prison for spreading propaganda, but the charges were dropped.The U.S.A. Volleyball board chairwoman Lori Okimura has also been outspoken on the cause.“This blatant gender discrimination of not allowing women access to purchase tickets to watch their teams play in Tehran, to me, significantly diminishes the accomplishments of the national teams in the world’s view,” she said Thursday. “Continuing to award Iran international volleyball events, when this condition is in effect, sends the message, loud and clear, that gender discrimination is accepted by the FIVB and its 221 member federations. It is not.”A version of this article appears in print on July 3, 2016, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Women in Iran Campaign For Access to Sports Events .
