The Jets want to re-sign Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has said he wants to re-sign with them. But with negotiations at an impasse, the Jets are not waiting around for him.They continued exploring other options at quarterback Friday by hosting Robert Griffin III, a No. 2 overall pick whose promising career in Washington foundered because of injuries and ineffectiveness. Griffin’s visit, first reported by ESPN, was confirmed by a person in football who insisted on anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.The Jets are among a few teams — most notably Cleveland, Denver and San Francisco — with unresolved situations at quarterback. The Jets’ interest in Griffin would not preclude them from retaining Fitzpatrick, but a market has yet to develop for him.Fitzpatrick wants a deal more in line with those signed by Brock Osweiler with Houston (average of $18 million per year) and Sam Bradford in Philadelphia ($17.5 million) rather than the one the Eagles gave Chase Daniel ($7 million) to back up Bradford.Unless competition emerges for Fitzpatrick, the Jets will have no incentive to budge, which is why they welcomed Griffin, whose tantalizing physical skills make him an appealing candidate for a revival with a different team.Once one of the N.F.L.’s most dynamic young players, Griffin, 26, went 5-15 after returning from a knee injury  that ended his rookie season. He sustained a concussion during training last year and then was benched before the season in favor of Kirk Cousins and did not play a snap. Rather than pay him $16.1 million in 2016, Washington cut Griffin on Monday.A version of this article appears in print on March 12, 2016, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Jets, Lacking Fitzpatrick, Host Griffin.
