PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. —  As another spring training workout day came to a close, a group of Mets pitchers gathered on a remote field for one last round of pitchers’ fielding practice, or P.F.P.s, as they are called. The players knelt in a semicircle on the infield as instructed, and a coach began hitting hard, chopping ground balls toward their chests.Meanwhile, Guy Conti, the Mets’ 73-year-old spring training czar, paced the field. The purpose of the drill was for the pitchers to snag the ball with their glove with one hand, without leaning or diving, as a way to work on their reaction time. In his raspy voice, Conti criticized or praised each pitcher’s form. He kept reminding them why drills like this were so important.“Twenty-seven outs in a game,” Conti said. “How many come from P.F.P.s?”No one answered, but they knew what was coming.“Three-point-five a game,” Conti said.The early part of spring training is generally filled with this type of basic fielding drills that players can easily find monotonous or extraneous. The players can sound like exasperated students asking why they need to learn geometry. Conti is the Mets’ antidote to that thinking.AdvertisementHe has spent 18 years working for the Mets, primarily behind the scenes in various roles, from minor league pitching coach to minor league field coordinator to major league bullpen coach. With his high cheekbones, sharp chin and clean-shaven look, he bears resemblance to a stereotypical drill sergeant. His current title is unspecific: senior adviser. But more precisely, for the last 14 years, for five Mets managers, Conti has coordinated the team’s daily spring training schedule.AdvertisementConti arrives at the complex each morning around 4:30 and delivers that day’s schedule to Manager Terry Collins’s desk so that Collins can make changes. Then, when the workout begins, as infielders take ground balls, outfielders take fly balls and pitchers practice pickoff throws, Conti roams from field to field making sure everything runs efficiently.“It takes a strange animal to do that,” said Jon Debus, the Mets’ pitching rehabilitation coordinator and a longtime friend of Conti’s. “First, you’ve got to be smart. There are so many moving pieces. You’re trying to make it as comfortable as possible so the work can get done. You’re always thinking: What can I do to make this go smoothly? Think about it: You have to move 50 players and 20 coaches around this complex within a minute of each other.“It’s not easy. He thinks about it all night long. The man doesn’t sleep.”When the pitchers arrive on Field No. 3 to work with Conti, usually for one of their last stations of the day, he runs them through a series of P.F.P.s that cover highly specific situations.They scoop slow rollers and flip the ball to the first baseman in one motion. They field slow rollers and drift into foul territory to throw to first base around imaginary runners. They sprint to cover first base on shallow ground balls that draw the first baseman out of position, and on ground balls deep down the line that keep the first baseman from reaching the bag.As the pitchers race to first base, Conti times them with a stopwatch and announces their readings aloud. He tells them to use their right foot, and to step only on the outside of the bag, because a base runner once stepped on the back of R. A. Dickey’s foot and Conti never forgot.“This is what it’s going to be like in a game!” Conti shouts.Conti also uses that time to preach about fielding bunts correctly, turning 3-6-1 double plays — first baseman to shortstop to the pitcher covering first — and setting one’s feet in order to make a sure throw. When the Mets make an exceptional fielding play during the season, they wonder if Conti was watching somewhere.During the season, Conti sticks around here, working on the minor league side, helping guide injured players through their rehabilitation, making sure everyone gets his work done — unless Collins has dispatched him on a special assignment to scout a player.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Over time, players learn more about his background, for he will drop names as he instructs players. Pedro Martinez comes up a lot. Conti is also a close friend of Sandy Koufax’s; they still get together with their wives for margherita pizza.AdvertisementWith certain players, Conti develops a deeper relationship. After Jacob deGrom’s starts, Conti sends him a text message with his opinions. When deGrom punched a cooler in frustration last year, with his pitching hand no less, Conti took notice and scolded him.“It won’t happen again,” deGrom assured him.After the Mets drafted David Wright as a teenager in 2001, Conti made a habit of spending extra time talking with him and visiting him on his minor league stops. When Wright missed curfew once and was called into Conti’s office, Wright felt as if he had let down his father.

He was a catcher in the Houston Colt .45s organization in the 1960s when an arm injury ended his career. “Had it been 2016, they would’ve fixed me,” Conti said. “Back then, they didn’t know what to do.”With a growing family to support, Conti started coaching high school baseball, then college baseball and even some college basketball until a friend helped him get a job with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Conti impressed his superiors with his work ethic, attention to detail and earnestness, and that led to a job in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. He made sure to listen whenever Koufax, Duke Snider or Johnny Podres was talking.Early on in his time with the Dodgers, they sent Conti to the Dominican Republic to scout the younger brother of Ramon Martinez, a pitcher named Pedro. Once the Dodgers had signed the younger Martinez at age 16, Conti took him under his wing. Conti’s wife, Jan, taught English to Martinez, and Conti taught him to throw a changeup, teaching it the same way that Podres did.When Conti and Martinez later reunited on the Mets, Martinez would not throw his bullpen sessions unless Conti was present. As a token of his appreciation for all Conti did, Martinez gave him a new car, a Yukon Denali.“I never flinch from the responsibility of developing the players: developing, developing, developing,” Conti said. “The big leagues is all about winning. The minors is about getting the players ready to win. It’s really satisfying when a kid like Pedro, when you start with him in rookie ball and he goes to the Hall of Fame.”Martinez had called to make sure Conti would attend his induction speech.“He brought up my name,” Conti said. “There’s 50,000 people there, and he’s talking about Guy Conti. He really — I mean, my wife and I. ...”AdvertisementConti stopped, looked off into the distance and started to cry.“You only get one or two Pedros,” he said. “Boy, he was something else.”A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2016, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets’ Longtime Drill Sergeant Keeps Everything in Line at Camp.
