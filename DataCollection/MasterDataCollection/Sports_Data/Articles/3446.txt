Steven Stamkos extended his goal-scoring streak to a season-high five games, and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the host Devils, 4-0, on Friday night for their fifth straight victory.Ben Bishop made 21 saves for his third shutout of the season. Alex Killorn, Ondrej Palat and Matt Carle also scored as the Lightning sent the Devils to a second straight loss and their fifth in six games.Stamkos’s goal-scoring streak is two games shy of his personal best, set in 2010.“For me, it’s was just about focusing in on my game, realizing I had some more to give, and just wanting to be confident again,” Stamkos said. Ryan Callahan had two assists for Tampa Bay, which moved to within 3 points of first-place Florida in the Atlantic Division.Cory Schneider, who was lifted after giving up three goals in the first period of a 6-1 loss to Columbus on Thursday, had 32 saves for the Devils.Advertisement“You can look at the numbers all you want, but we’ve just got to start stringing some wins together and see where that takes us,” Devils forward Kyle Palmieri said.AdvertisementThe contest was not as one-sided as the score, but Tampa Bay was able to convert its chances while the Devils battled both the puck and Bishop.Stamkos set up Killorn’s first-period goal with great strength in front, and he extended his goal-scoring streak with a deflection of Anton Stralman’s shot late in the second for a 3-0 lead.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
