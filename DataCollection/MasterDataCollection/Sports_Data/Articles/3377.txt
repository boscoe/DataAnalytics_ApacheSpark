Stephen Curry spoke after he scored 17 points in overtime, an N.B.A. record, in the Golden State Warriors' 132-125 playoff victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.Overtime is the ultimate crucible of basketball: five tense minutes, with the game potentially turning on every possession.Stephen Curry on Monday scored more points in an overtime period than any other player in N.B.A. history. And he did it in the playoffs, after missing four games with a knee injury.The signs were not initially auspicious. Curry was 2 for 13 from 3-point range in regulation after coming off the bench, and looked rusty.Things improved late. Curry was 0 for his first 9 from distance, but then hit a long 3 with four and a half minutes left and had some good assists in the fourth quarter. He missed a running one-hander that would have won it in regulation, but Warriors fans had reason to hope he would be back in form for overtime.AdvertisementHere’s what followed from Curry, who won his second consecutive M.V.P. award on Tuesday:
