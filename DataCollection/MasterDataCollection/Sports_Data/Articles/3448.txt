PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. —  At first, Brandon Nimmo did not notice that anything was wrong. It was mid-January, and he was training for the season with purpose after the Mets had added him to the 40-man roster. He ran through his conditioning drills, lifted weights, hit for a little while and ate lunch. Only later did he notice the pain in his left foot.Nimmo, the Mets’ first-round pick in 2013, discovered that he had partly torn a tendon.This week he arrived for spring training, but he still has about two to three weeks of rehabilitation ahead of him before he can begin baseball activities, wiping out any chance he had to impress the Mets’ coaches.“It’s definitely frustrating,” Nimmo said.Nimmo had a breakout 2014 season, posting a .394 on-base percentage while splitting time between Class A and Class AA. But in 2015, as he ascended in the system and faced tougher pitchers, his progress slowed. He compiled a .269 batting average and a .362 on-base percentage last year, but he missed playing time because of a sprained anterior cruciate ligament.“I’m looking at this season as a way to try to do what I can and help in any way that I can,” Nimmo said. “But obviously I need to get healthy.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
