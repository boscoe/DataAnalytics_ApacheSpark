INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Serena Williams is expected to be joined by her sister Venus in the women’s field for the BNP Paribas Open in March, a year after Serena ended a 14-year boycott and returned to the desert tournament.Venus Williams was on the entry lists for the two-week tournament released Wednesday. Top-ranked Serena Williams leads the women’s field and No. 1 Novak Djokovic heads the men’s draw. Djokovic has won the event four times, including last year.After being warmly welcomed back last year, Serena withdrew shortly before her semifinal, citing a knee injury. It was the same circumstances under which Venus withdrew about 20 minutes before her semifinal against Serena in the 2001 event. That angered the crowd, which heavily booed Serena during the title match, which she won. Serena, then 19, was so upset she refused to play in the desert again until last year.Venus Williams has not played Indian Wells since 2001.“We are thrilled that Venus Williams, one of the greatest women’s players in the history of the game, is returning to play in the BNP Paribas Open,” said the Indian Wells chief executive, Raymond Moore, in a statement. “Our fans embraced Serena last year, and we expect nothing less for Venus when she returns to compete at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.”Also in the women’s field are Simona Halep, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Caroline Wozniacki.Among those joining Djokovic on the men’s side are the four-time champion Roger Federer, the three-time champion Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Tennis; Venus Williams to Return.
