Noah Syndergaard of the Mets uses his 6-foot-6 frame, a high leg kick and a deliberate windup to transform himself into one of baseball’s most powerful pitchers. But it is exactly those attributes that make his delivery one of the slowest in the major leagues — a delivery that base stealers exploit. Here is the timing of one of his pitches during the season opener against the Atlanta Braves.
Last season, Syndergaard’s delivery times ranked 248th out of 278 pitchers with at least 100 recorded times by Baseball Info Solutions. His average delivery time (from the start of his windup until the ball hit the catcher’s glove) was 1.65 seconds, 0.25 of a second slower than the league average. He was clocked as slow as 2.04. These slow times resulted in Syndergaard’s giving up the most stolen bases of any pitcher in baseball.Pitchers who gave up the most steals in 2016Noah Syndergaard48Jimmy Nelson30Jon Lester28Ubaldo Jimenez26Jake Arrieta23Cole Hamels23Not only did he give up the most stolen bases, but base stealers were also successful 84.2 percent of the time compared with the major league average of 71.7 percent.Good base stealers can get to second base in about 3.4 seconds; some get there even faster. Syndergaard’s catcher, usually Rene Rivera, can catch the ball, transfer it to his throwing hand and get it to second base in an average of 1.91 seconds. (The league average for catchers is 1.98.) That leaves Syndergaard only 1.5 seconds to go through his wind-up and throw the pitch to Rivera. That’s the problem: Syndergaard’s delivery is rarely that fast.Syndergaard’s 2016 delivery times (seconds)1.32Fastest1.40Major League average1.65Average2.04SlowestWith Syndergaard’s average delivery time at 1.65 seconds, he and Rivera have to hope for a slow base stealer or one who gets a slow jump from first base.1.91 seconds3.56 secondsRivera’s averagetime to second baseTotal time fromSyndergaard to Riverato second1.65 secondsSyndergaard’s averagepitch-delivery time3.40 secondsA good base stealer’stime to second1.91 seconds3.56 secondsTotal time from Syndergaard to Rivera to secondRivera’s average timeto second base1.65 secondsSyndergaard’s averagepitch-delivery time3.40 secondsA good base stealer’s time to second1.91 seconds3.56 secondsTotal time from Syndergaardto Rivera to secondRivera’s average timeto second base1.65 seconds3.40 secondsA good base stealer’stime to secondSyndergaard’s averagepitch-delivery time1.91 seconds3.56 secondsRivera’s averagetime to second baseTotal time fromSyndergaard to Riverato second1.65 secondsSyndergaard’s averagepitch-delivery time3.40 secondsA good base stealer’stime to secondA right-handed pitcher’s delivery to home begins when his left heel comes off the ground. That is what many base stealers look for as their cue to steal. But if the right heel comes up first, the base runner dashes back to first base because the pitcher is about to attempt a pickoff throw.Left heel: Go Once a right-hander lifts his left heel, he must continue his delivery to home or be called for a balk. So if the runner sees that heel come up first, he is off and running.Right heel: Get back If the right heel comes off the ground first, the runner darts back, because a right-handed pitcher is about to pivot and step toward first base to attempt a pickoff throw.2016 pitcher and catcher timing data from Baseball Info Solutions.
