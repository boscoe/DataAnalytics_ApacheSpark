TAMPA, Fla. — Any suspension of Yankees reliever Aroldis Chapman by Commissioner Rob Manfred under Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy would be unlikely to begin before opening day, according to a baseball official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.While Major League Baseball can suspend Chapman from participating in spring training — as it did with Colorado Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes, who was barred Tuesday at least until his criminal case is adjudicated — Manfred is not expected to do so. The Yankees’ first spring training game is March 2 against the Detroit Tigers.Manfred is reviewing reports that baseball investigators have prepared on Chapman and Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig, each of whom faced domestic-violence accusations during the off-season. Manfred said Monday that he expected to resolve the cases soon. The cases of Chapman, Puig and Reyes are the first tests of a policy that was developed with the players’ union and instituted in August.A key difference between Reyes and Chapman is that Chapman is not facing criminal charges. Prosecutors declined to bring charges against him because of conflicting accounts and uncooperative witnesses after the Davie, Fla., police reported that Chapman had fired eight shots into his garage after a physical altercation with his girlfriend.On Tuesday, Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said he thought that Chapman could be suspended from games during spring training, adding that he thought Chapman would be able to participate in workouts during such a suspension.A version of this article appears in print on February 25, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Chapman Unlikely to Be Barred at Camp.
