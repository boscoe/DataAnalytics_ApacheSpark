The Sablich brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The New York Times since 2010. See their weekly player rankings and visit 5thDownFantasy.com for more fantasy analysis. You can also ask them questions through their Twitter account, @5thdownfantasy.Philip Rivers (SD vs. Raiders) — Rivers has struggled over his last two games despite throwing for a pair of touchdowns in each one. He has had 14 touchdowns over his last six games. This week, he faces a Raiders team that yielded Rivers’s best fantasy performance of the season (28.4 fantasy points) and yields the 10th most points to the position over all. He may be expected to carry the offense more than usual because running back Melvin Gordon is banged up.Tyrod Taylor (BUF vs. Browns) — He has not exactly earned the right to be on anyone’s fantasy radar in recent weeks, but anyone facing the Browns has to be in the conversation, and Taylor is talented enough to do some damage this weekend. Only two quarterbacks have thrown fewer than two touchdowns in a game against Cleveland this season.Sleeper: Alex Smith (KC vs. Titans)Proceed With Caution: Matthew Stafford (DET at Giants)
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard scoring formats and will be updated each week.            Devonta Freeman (ATL vs. 49ers) — I’m expecting a bounce-back performance after his disappointing use in a Week 14 blowout win against the Rams. Freeman wasn’t needed as much and was pulled with other Falcons starters late in the game. There is a danger that this game will be another blowout, but the matchup is good enough that Freeman should have ample chances.AdvertisementLeSean McCoy (BUF vs. Browns) — Anyone still alive in the fantasy playoffs should be thrilled to have McCoy playing at home against the Browns in a crucial Week 15 fantasy matchup. Cleveland’s run defense ranks 31st in the N.F.L. and has allowed the second most fantasy points and the second most touchdowns (14) to the position. Meanwhile, McCoy has 63.3 fantasy points over the last three games.AdvertisementLeGarrette Blount (NE at Broncos) — Blount takes his league-leading 14 rushing touchdowns to Denver, which has allowed the fourth most rushing yards per game (127.2). He has failed to score at least one touchdown in only three games this season.Sleeper: Jerick McKinnon (MIN vs. Colts)Proceed With Caution: Todd Gurley (LA at Seahawks)Tyreek Hill (KC vs. Titans) — No team allows more fantasy points to the position than the Titans, who allowed five receiving touchdowns to five different receivers over the last three games. Hill has a touchdown and 16-plus fantasy points in two of his last three games.Alshon Jeffery (CHI vs. Packers) — He’s back and should be very motivated to perform well for the rest of the season. (He’s in his contract year.) A matchup with the Packers should help him get his final stretch off to the right start. Green Bay’s 19 receiving touchdowns allowed are the third most in the league, and the Packers allow the fourth most fantasy points to the position.Mike Wallace (BAL vs. Eagles) — He has been held out of the end zone in five consecutive games but has remained a central part of the team’s passing attack. He is far from a slam dunk, but I like him to put up his best numbers in a while against the Eagles, who yield the second most yards and fantasy points to the position.Sleeper: Jamison Crowder (WAS vs. Panthers)Proceed With Caution: A.

He was the intended receiver on an end-zone throw that was intercepted last week, but he hauled in a touchdown pass the week before. His Week 15 matchup with the Bengals is promising; Cincinnati has given up the fourth most fantasy points to the position, including two touchdowns to Pittsburgh tight ends in Week 2.Sleeper: Charles Clay (BUF vs. Browns)Proceed With Caution: Dennis Pitta (BAL vs. Eagles)Defense/Special TeamsStart: BUF vs. Browns; NYG vs. Lions.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
