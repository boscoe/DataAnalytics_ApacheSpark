FOXBOROUGH, Mass. —  The crowd roar at Gillette Stadium soared last month with each tackle Patriots running back James White broke — sprinting past a linebacker, spinning away from a safety, stiff-arming a cornerback — before weakening in disappointment when he was brought down inside the 10-yard line.The undulating cheers peaked in appreciation of the apparent 71-yard play, then turned into booing at the all-too-familiar sight of a yellow flag lying near the Patriots’ offense.It signaled yet another offensive pass interference penalty. The long gain was nullified by a call against wide receiver Keshawn Martin for obstructing a Tennessee Titans player from covering White.The sequence, which occurred during Week 15, was indicative of the big-play potential of the high-traffic, short-passing game and of the conundrum faced by N.F.L. officials, who must govern the intent, nature and location of downfield contact in an instant.AdvertisementThe teams in this weekend’s N.F.L. playoffs rank among the most efficient practitioners of the increasingly common line-of-scrimmage passing game, in which offenses deploy teammates on what are called rub routes, or pick plays, to spring open targets. The goal is to combat an increase in man-to-man coverage by larger cornerbacks, who are jamming receivers. Picking is legal so long as it happens no more than 1 yard downfield.AdvertisementIn the last two decades, micro-passing plays have gone from playbook afterthought to offensive staple, Trent Dilfer, the former quarterback who is now an ESPN analyst, said. “A lot of the N.F.L.’s business is done in that space, and it’s really changed how the game is played,” he said.Pick plays will be on display this postseason, particularly in the small confines of the red zone or as a counter to blitzes.New England zigs and zags its receivers, tight ends and running backs near the line as effectively as anyone. Quarterback Tom Brady threw no farther than 10 yards downfield on 73.1 percent of his passes all season and on 26 of his 36 touchdowns, according to Stats L.L.C., a sports statistics provider. He has a 107.5 passer rating on short attempts this year.Brady averaged 7.3 yards per short attempt, a yard and a half better than the league standard. Of Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola’s combined 175 targets, 78 percent were on passes that traveled fewer than 10 yards. Brady’s average yards per completion this season was greater than 10, owing to the team’s ability to get Edelman and Amendola the ball in open space.Bucky Brooks, an N.F.L. Media analyst, said the press coverage needed to slow those receivers typically leaves tight end Rob Gronkowski in one-on-one coverage, a dangerous situation for a pass defense.“Your offensive line is unable to protect some of these athletes that are crashing off the edges,” Brooks said, adding that the threat can be diminished by putting the onus on veteran quarterbacks like Brady, Denver’s Peyton Manning and Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers to make quick “catch-and-fire throws.”Among the playoff quarterbacks, Kansas City’s Alex Smith threw the most short passes (76.2 percent of attempts) and Pittsburgh’s Ben Roethlisberger completed the most (77.3 percent). Washington’s Kirk Cousins had the best rating on short passes (105.2) after Brady, and Arizona’s Carson Palmer gained the most yardage per attempt (6.8 yards) after Brady.AdvertisementBrooks said Cousins’s short-game success over the middle of the field was the reason Washington, which hosts Green Bay on Sunday, played so well down the stretch.The Patriots’ success in the short passing game has come at a steep cost: 11 offensive pass interference penalties. The league average was three, and no other team had more than seven, according to the website N.F.L. Penalty Tracker.“You have to run every play just like it’s drawn up,” Patriots tight end Michael Williams said. “And it just so happens that somebody gets in your way, you try to avoid but, it’s just the game’s so fast, sometimes you can’t help it.”On the Week 15 pick play against Tennessee, Martin and White ran short crossing routes in the left flat. Martin collided with Titans linebacker Brian Orakpo, who had lined up as an outside rusher before backpedaling into coverage, and that helped spring White free.

Asked what Martin could have done differently, New England Coach Bill Belichick responded: “That’s a good question. You should ask the league about that. They’re the ones that call it, so let them talk about it.”Rule 8, Section 5, Article 4 of the N.F.L. rule book grants offensive players freedom to make contact within a yard of the line of scrimmage. Dean Blandino, the vice president for officiating, wrote in an email that such pass interference penalties were a “judgment call on when contact occurs.” They cannot be reviewed.Collisions are also allowed if they occur after the pass is touched downfield.The other challenge is distinguishing a purposeful pick from incidental contact.Advertisement“It’s the old notion of ‘Who initiates the contact?’ ” said Mike Pereira, Blandino’s predecessor. “We always talk about block-charge. That was the best way we can relate it, to go to basketball and say, ‘Think of it as block-charge. If the defender has his position established and the offensive player runs into him, then it’s a charge.’ Therefore, it turns into offensive pass interference in football.”“If the defensive player slides into the receiver, then it’s basically a block and it’s on the defender,” he continued, “so it’s not a foul in that situation.”The incidence of these types of pick plays reached a critical mass before the 2014 season, at which time the N.F.L. stressed enforcement of the rules. There were only 75 offensive pass interference penalties in 2013. The next season, that number nearly doubled, to 145, before dipping slightly, to 133, this season.“The competition committee placed an overall emphasis on downfield contact, regardless of if it was initiated by the offensive or defensive player,” Blandino wrote. “The committee observed slip screens and bubble screens becoming a more prevalent part of offensive game plans, with wide receivers being called upon to do more blocking on a regular basis.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He said the officials’ emphasis on downfield contact had altered play a lot.“You have to know how to do it without creating so much contact and making it so obvious that you’re picking,” Randle said. “You’ve got to actually look like you’re running a route.”AdvertisementA famous example of a pick play decided last season’s Super Bowl between the Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.Trailing by 4, the Seahawks had second-and-goal late in the fourth quarter. The call was for Jermaine Kearse to pick at the goal line while Ricardo Lockette slanted in underneath the screen. The Patriots’ Brandon Browner — 6-foot-4 and 221 pounds — jammed Kearse to minimize the obstruction to his teammate, Malcolm Butler, who stepped in front of Lockette for the interception that sealed the victory.For some, that play was the textbook way to defend such a route.“You want to try to get into him and jam him,” Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said. “That way he can’t go pick, kind of hold him off for the other guy to make a decision.”Other effective defensive schemes involved two defensive backs switching coverage assignments depending on the direction the two receivers release, and outside rushers beating blocks and getting their hands in the air to disrupt passing lanes.For Butler, defending a pick play has a basic foundation.“Communication, that’s the big thing,” he said. “If you don’t have that, you don’t have too much.”A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2016, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Short Passes Fly, More Picks Are Set, and Penalties Follow.
