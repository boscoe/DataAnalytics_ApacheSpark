Russell Westbrook tallied his 42nd triple-double on Sunday night, breaking the season record set by Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 with the Cincinnati Royals. Westbrook’s 50-point, 16-rebound, 10-assist performance in the Oklahoma City Thunder’s 106-105 comeback win over the Denver Nuggets included a 3-pointer at the buzzer. And it capped a feat that is amazing in many ways — some obvious, some not as much.1. Going into Sunday, Westbrook was averaging 31.7 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists per game. He will be the second player in history to average a triple-double in a season, after Robertson.2. Westbrook has twice as many triple-doubles this season as any other N.B.A. player. James Harden is next with 21, followed by LeBron James with 13. Entering Sunday, the rest of the league combined had 38.3. No other Thunder player has a triple-double this season. Kevin Durant, now with the Golden State Warriors, had one last season with the Thunder. The last player other than Westbrook and Durant to record a triple-double for the Thunder was Serge Ibaka, in 2012. The last player for the franchise with more than one triple-double in a season was Gary Payton, in 2002, when the team was the Seattle SuperSonics.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Westbrook has 79 career triple-doubles, putting him fourth on the career list behind Robertson, Magic Johnson and Jason Kidd. His 42 this season would be good enough for eighth all time.Advertisement5. Westbrook’s triple-double total by season since he joined the league in 2008-9: 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 11, 18, 42.Advertisement6. Thirteen of Westbrook’s triple-doubles this season have come in three quarters or less.7. Westbrook scored 57 points against the Orlando Magic on March 29, surpassing the record for points scored while collecting a triple-double. Scoring 50 points in a triple-double has been done five times this season: three times by Westbrook and twice by Harden. From 1976 to 2015, it was never done.8. Westbrook has scored a triple-double this season against 27 of 29 opponents, failing only against the Chicago Bulls and the Portland Trail Blazers. (And he fell just one rebound short against Chicago.)9. When Robertson set his mark, it was not especially heralded: The term triple-double was not regularly used at the time. Though other publications started a little earlier, The New York Times first gingerly tried it in 1984, though it used a clunky variant, saying that Jeff Ruland "responded with a triple double-digit effort.”10. Robertson’s 1961-62 season was good for only third in the M.V.P. voting, behind Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. Westbrook will probably better that, too.A version of this list appears in print on April 10, 2017, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Westbrook’s Triple-Double Record Is Singular.
