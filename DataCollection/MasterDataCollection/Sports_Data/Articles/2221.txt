Gut’s only challenger, Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, needs a series of unlikely finishes in the final week in order to win the title.Rebensburg’s 18th-place finish in a race won by Cornelia Hütter left her trailing Gut by 295 points. She will skip the combined event Sunday and the slalom in finals week, starting Wednesday in St. Moritz, Switzerland.Rebensburg would need to win her last three races in St. Moritz — gaining 300 points in total — and hope that Gut fails to score there. Rebensburg has never scored in a race involving a slalom. Gut, a 24-year-old Swiss, needs 6 more points to earn the crystal globe trophy awarded to the best all-around skier. A top-25 finish would secure it on Sunday.Lindsey Vonn of the United States had been leading the overall standings, but she sustained a season-ending injury to her left knee two weeks ago that ended her shot at a fifth overall title. TIGHT RACE FOR DOWNHILL TITLE Dominik Paris won the next-to-last downhill of the World Cup season, leaving the fight for the discipline title wide open.Paris trails his fellow Italian Peter Fill by 4 points going into the final race Wednesday at St. Moritz. Kjetil Jansrud of Norway, 54 points behind, and Adrien Theaux of France, 66 behind, are also in contention. Fill has 436 points and shares the lead with Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway. But Svindal is sidelined after knee surgery. Paris won Saturday in Kvitfjell, Norway, by 0.2 of a second over Valentin Giraud Moine of France. Advertisement
