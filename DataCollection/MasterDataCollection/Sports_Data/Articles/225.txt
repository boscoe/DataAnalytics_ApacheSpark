Grigor Dimitrov played until 2 a.m. on Sunday as he beat Richard Gasquet to reach the Australian Open’s round of 16, recalling the tournament’s notorious late — or early — finishes.Play began at two minutes to midnight, and Dimitrov took 2 hours 2 minutes to oust Gasquet, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, following Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams into the fourth round.The timing had echoes of the 2008 clash between Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, which started at 11:47 p.m. and wrapped up at a bleary-eyed 4:34 a.m. the next day. And in 2012, the men’s singles final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal started before 8 p.m. and went on for a record 5:53, finishing at 1:40 a.m.This year, Nadal used his trademark grit to grind out a thrilling 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 win over the 19-year-old Alexander Zverev.AdvertisementThe victory meant that Nadal, 30, joined Roger Federer in the round of 16 of a contest missing the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, after his stunning second-round loss to Denis Istomin.AdvertisementWilliams, by contrast, had no such trouble as she brushed off Nicole Gibbs, 6-1, 6-3, to maintain her charge toward a 23rd Grand Slam singles title.Williams, back after an injury break at the end of 2016, will take some stopping as she closes in on Steffi Graf’s Open-era record for Grand Slam titles.The next player to face Williams will be Barbora Strycova, who ousted Caroline Garcia of France to earn a shot at Williams, the world No. 2.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
