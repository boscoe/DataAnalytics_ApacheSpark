The worst of the freezing rain is expected to start late Saturday night and continue into Sunday morning and early afternoon.Although snowstorms in the past have prompted the league to change the site and days of regular-season games — the Vikings had three games affected in 2010 alone — the N.F.L. says it believes this is the first time a postseason game has been shifted since 1932.That year, a blizzard forced the first playoff game, between the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans, to move indoors, to Chicago Stadium from Wrigley Field. That game, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, was played on a field with altered dimensions — 80 yards long, instead of 100, and 10 yards narrower.Advertisement
