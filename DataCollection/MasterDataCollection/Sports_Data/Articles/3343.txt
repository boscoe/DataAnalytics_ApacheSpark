Grigory Rodchenkov, the antidoping laboratory director, said that each night a sports official sent him a list of athletes whose samples needed to be swapped.Athletes also sent photos of their doping control forms to help identify which urine sample were theirs.Upon receiving a signal, usually after midnight, Dr. Rodchenkov went to Room 124. The room was officially a storage space, but he and his team had converted it into a laboratory.Room 124 was next to the official sample collection room where the bottles of urine were kept.Room 124Room 125Sochi Olympicantidoping laboratorySecured areaFirst floorEntranceEntranceRoom 124 Storage space where Dr. Rodchenkov and his team worked.HoleRoom 125 Official urine sample collection room.Urine sample bottles were passed through a hole between the two rooms.Room 124Room 125Secured areaFirstfloorSochi OlympicantidopinglaboratoryEntranceRoom 124 Storage space where Dr. Rodchenkov and his team worked.HoleRoom 125 Official urine sample collection room.Urine sample bottles were passed through a hole between the two rooms.Room 124Room 125First floorSecured areaSochi OlympicantidopinglaboratoryEntranceUrine sample bottles were passed through a hole between the two rooms.Room 124 Storage space where Dr. Rodchenkov and his team worked.HoleRoom 125 Official urine sample collection room.Room 124Room 125Sochi Olympicantidoping laboratorySecured areaFirst floorEntranceEntranceRoom 124 Storage space where Dr. Rodchenkov and his team worked.HoleRoom 125 Official urine sample collection room.Urine sample bottles were passed through a hole between the two rooms.A colleague in the collection room passed the urine samples through a hole in the wall near the floor.

When it is time to test the urine sample, the cap is removed by breaking it into two parts with tools or machines sold by Berlinger.Unique 7-digit codeSecurity cap locks by pushing down while screwing it on.Spring pushes the metal ring against the glass teeth.Metal ring with teeth prevents bottle from being opened. Glass teeth lock against the metal teeth. Unique 7-digit codeUnique 7-digit codeSecurity cap locks by pushing down while screwing it on.Spring pushes the metal ring against the glass teeth.Metal ring with teeth prevents bottle from being opened. Glass teeth lock against the metal teeth. Unique 7-digit codeIn Room 124, Dr. Rodchenkov received the sealed bottles through the hole and handed them to a man who he believed was a Russian intelligence officer. The man took the bottles to a building nearby. Within a few hours, the bottles were returned with the caps loose and unbroken.Dr. Rodchenkov’s team emptied and cleaned the bottles with filter paper and filled them with untainted urine collected from the athletes months before the Olympics.They would then add table salt or water to balance out any inconsistencies in the recorded specifications of the two samples. Depending on what an athlete had consumed, two urine samples taken at different times could vary.A third of Russia’s 33 medals were awarded to athletes whose names appeared on a spreadsheet outlining the government’s doping plan.Advertisement
