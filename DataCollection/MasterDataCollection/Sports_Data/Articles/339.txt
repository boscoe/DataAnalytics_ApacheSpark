LONDON — Dele Alli and Harry Kane kept Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League title hunt with a 2-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday in White Hart Lane’s final North London derby.Chelsea had extended its advantage to 7 points by winning, 3-0, at Everton earlier in the day, but Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs cut the gap back to 4 points with a thrilling display.The two goals arrived within 146 seconds of each other in the second half, with Alli polishing off a rebound and Kane converting a penalty.The victory also ensured that Spurs will finish above Arsenal for the first time since 1995, ending 22 years of what is know as St Totteringham’s Day — the unofficial holiday celebrated by Arsenal fans when their team could no longer be overtaken by Tottenham in the league table.Spurs will play at Wembley next season before moving into its new stadium — which is being built partly on the site of the team’s current home — in August 2018. Sunday’s win was Tottenham’s ninth in a row.Arsenal Manager Arsène Wenger’s 50th North London derby ended with a fifth defeat in six away games for the Gunners, leaving Arsenal six points out of a Champions League slot in sixth place. Arsenal retains a game in hand on its other rivals, however, and its disappointment was mitigated by the fact top-four rivals Manchester City and Manchester United both dropped points earlier in the day.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
