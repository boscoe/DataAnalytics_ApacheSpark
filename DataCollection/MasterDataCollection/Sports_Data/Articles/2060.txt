Four more are on junior varsity and postgraduate teams. Lourawls Nairn Jr., known as Tum Tum, a sophomore at Michigan State and a Bahamian, is an alumnus, as are current players at the Division I programs Stephen F. Austin and Louisiana-Monroe.Then there is Sunrise Christian’s most famous graduate, Bahamian or otherwise: Oklahoma guard Buddy Hield.AdvertisementThis season, Hield and Michigan State’s Denzel Valentine have raced to a photo finish in the national player of the year race. Hield is Division I’s second-leading scorer, averaging 25.0 points and shooting 46.4 percent from 3-point range. He has made the sixth-ranked Sooners (25-7) contenders for the national title, which would be the first in Oklahoma’s history. Oklahoma, the second seed in the West Region, will play 15th-seeded C.S.U. Bakersfield in the first round.An accounting of Hield’s on-the-court achievements undersells how compelling he is. In a star-starved season for college basketball, Hield’s charismatic play, earnest off-court personality and flashy haircut have made him the face of the college game. The stories of his training — the crate he hung on a pole in the Bahamas, the endless workouts at Oklahoma’s complex — are rote. His step-back 3-pointers remind some observers of Stephen Curry.AdvertisementTo hear Hield tell it, Sunrise Christian was integral to his success.“Being there changed my life,” he said. “They gave me the opportunity to come to America and play basketball.”The pairing is an unlikely story. In a universe of basketball factories that cater to top prospects, Sunrise Christian requires teenagers used to beach weather to brave winters in Wichita, where building-to-building bridges downtown indicate brutal winter months, and to study the Bible in a school population of mostly locals. The tall teenagers amble through narrow hallways lined with pictures of the Founding Fathers and inspirational quotations from Scripture.But Sunrise Christian and Hield were a perfect match.“God put them together,” said Hield’s mother, Jackie Swann.Hield, 22, the fifth of seven children, grew up in the township of Eight Mile Rock, near Freeport on the island of Grand Bahama.“Growing up was hard for them,” Swann said of her children.Even the story behind Hield’s cuddly nickname is somewhat macabre. Swann’s original nickname for her son Chavano was Buds, after a friend suggested he looked like Bud Bundy, a character on the American sitcom “Married ... With Children.” It was changed to Buddy, Swann said, when another friend pointed out that Bud was the name of a recently murdered neighborhood drug dealer.“Sometimes, when you go through life and things are so hard and difficult, you take bad things and make yourself happy,” Swann said. “He turned a negative into positive.”AdvertisementBy 2010, in the spring of Hield’s sophomore year of high school, Kyle Lindsted, then Sunrise Christian’s coach, had already persuaded several Bahamian players to come to Kansas. By then, he had been a regular at the Jaguars Basketball Showcase in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, for more than a decade.That year, Lindsted sat in the stands talking with a former player’s mother, who mentioned Hield. Lindsted saw an undersized, moderately athletic youngster with a good shot but, above all, charisma.“Wherever he was, he was making people laugh,” said Lindsted, who is in his first season as an assistant coach at Wichita State.Lindsted invited Hield to come to Sunrise Christian. (The school awards financial aid based on need, frequently with the help of designated sponsors.) Swann, persuaded by Hield’s eagerness and swayed by Sunrise Christian’s religious values, agreed to let him go.“Buddy went to Sunrise, and they became family to Buddy,” she said. “I never had to worry about him.” Birth of a Basketball Power When Lindsted calls Sunrise Christian a mom-and-pop organization, he is speaking literally. His father, Robert, founded the school and runs it.Robert Lindsted was an engineering professor at Wichita State in the early 1980s when he grew dissatisfied with his children’s educational options. So he started his own school, with six students and a teacher. Three decades later, the school has more than 600 students, starting in prekindergarten, and sister schools in Haiti, Myanmar, Guatemala, Brazil and Lebanon.It is a missionary, though nondenominational, school. Bible study is mandatory. Most seniors go on a school trip to Israel, which Robert Lindsted has visited more than 60 times. (He said he hosted Yitzhak Rabin when the former Israeli prime minister, at the time Israel’s minister of defense, visited Wichita.)AdvertisementSunrise Christian initially fielded a basketball team because Lindsted’s sons wanted to play, and because his brother-in-law had been a coach at Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. Soon after graduating, Kyle Lindsted became Sunrise Christian’s coach, and he built the program into a power that now attracts top players, participates in the most prominent high school tournaments and is signed to a uniform deal with Nike.The school has become an attractive fit for players from the Bahamas, which sends a steady stream of athletes brought up in a discipline-oriented, religious society and eager to seek opportunities in the United States.“The Bahamians work harder because we don’t want to go back home,” said Radshad Davis, a Sunrise Christian senior from Nassau. “The Americans go back home, they can just switch schools, go to another school. We don’t have that opportunity.”The academics are often the most difficult adjustment. During Nairn’s first year, according to Robert Lindsted, he had no lunch break so he could fit in all the classes he would need to graduate and be eligible for college basketball.Also grueling is a workout regimen, with 5:30 a.m. training runs, conditioning drills and weight lifting in a small room off the school’s main hallway.“Basketball over here is more organized,” said Godfree Rolle, a senior who comes from the Abacos, a group of islands in the Bahamas. There is a lot to learn on defense, Rolle said, referring to methods of defending the pick-and-roll: “I didn’t know what is ‘hedge,’ what is ‘down the ball screen.’ I didn’t know any of that stuff before I came here.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

(Coach Luke Barnwell was late to practice one day last week because he is one of the few staff members with a commercial driver’s license, and he was needed to drive the drama club to an event.)But while the juxtaposition of Bahamian basketball talent and an evangelical school near the geographic center of the United States might seem odd to some, Robert Lindsted described a symbiotic relationship.“Basketball can’t get you to heaven,” he said. “But basketball might take you to Sunrise, and we can tell you how to get to heaven.”Lindsted added: “I think basketball is the connecting arm to lots of things in life. And I think life is bigger than basketball. What I hope that we give these kids when they leave here is a passion to develop whatever skill they’ve got.Advertisement“In Buddy’s case, it’s basketball. But Buddy’s strong suit isn’t basketball. Buddy’s strong suit is Buddy.” An Outgoing Leader Hield’s most magnetic talents were on display at a Wednesday shootaround in Kansas City, Mo., a day before the Big 12 Conference tournament quarterfinals. He was loose, yelling “Bucket!” after his first shot, a 3-pointer, went in. He made the next four as well.Once organized drills began, Hield exhorted his teammates: “Big shots, big shots, you’re hot.” He also sneaked in spare shots whenever he could, and took pauses to greet onlookers he knew.Jonquel Jones, a childhood friend of Hield’s and a frequent training partner who is currently a senior on George Washington’s N.C.A.A. tournament-bound women’s team, said that Hield’s outgoing personality was partly a product of his culture. She compared entering a store in the United States to doing so in the Bahamas: In the States, one expects the shopkeeper to extend a greeting; in the latter, one is expected to do the greeting oneself.“People speak to each other,” she said. “You don’t pass someone and not say, ‘How are you doing?’ ”She also confirmed that Hield had become the talk of every town back home.“Everything that’s happened with him is well deserved,” she said. “You don’t really get the full idea of how hard he actually works until you actually see him working in person.”Before Wednesday night’s game, the Big 12 commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, presented Hield with the trophy awarded to the conference player of the year. It was the second consecutive season Hield had received the honor.AdvertisementAfter posing for the obligatory photographs with Bowlsby, Hield waved forcefully to his teammates, who were huddled near their bench, and they all sprinted over to join him for the pictures that, it was apparent, Hield really wanted.In the game that followed, against the defending Big 12 champion, Iowa State, Hield scored 39 points in a 79-76 victory. In a joint postgame on-court interview, he heaped praise on his longtime rival Georges Niang, the Iowa State senior.Later, Oklahoma Coach Lon Kruger was asked about Hield’s decision to beckon for his teammates during the ceremony before the game.“It’s not a surprise Buddy would do that,” Kruger said. “He knows it’s a shared honor.”An article last Monday about Sunrise Christian Academy, in Wichita, Kan., which has developed into a pipeline for basketball players from the Bahamas, including the Oklahoma star Buddy Hield, included outdated statistics for Hield in some editions. He was averaging 25.0 points per game, not 25.6, and shooting 46.4 percent from 3-point range, not 47 percent. And because of an editing error, the article misstated the day of an Oklahoma team shootaround, in which the Sooners prepared for the Big 12 Conference tournament quarterfinals. It was Wednesday, March 9 — not Thursday, March 10.A version of this article appears in print on March 14, 2016, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Cultivating Bahamian Talent on the Plains.
