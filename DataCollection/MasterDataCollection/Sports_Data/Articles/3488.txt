TURIN, Italy —  Juventus came back from two goals down to salvage a 2-2 tie against Bayern Munich on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League match.Thomas Müller and Arjen Robben scored shortly before and shortly after halftime for Bayern, but Paulo Dybala reduced the deficit with his first Champions League goal shortly after the game’s hour mark.That seemed to inspire Juventus, which almost tied the game shortly afterward, before the substitute Stefano Sturaro scored the tying goal 14 minutes before the end of regulation.Manuel Neuer, the visiting goalkeeper, was mainly a spectator in the first half, often the only player on his side of the field.Bayern appeared headed for a fourth successive win against Juventus, but the hosts kept attacking and got one back in the 63rd when Mario Mandzukic took advantage of Joshua Kimmich’s poor clearance to send Dybala clear and past Neuer.The equalizer came from an unlikely source as Alvaro Morata nodded on Mandzukic’s pass to Sturaro, who fired in off the underside of the bar.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Down by 2, Juventus Storms Back to Gain a Tie.
