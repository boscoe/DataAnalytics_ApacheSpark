LIVERPOOL, England — Pedro’s sublime goal helped move Chelsea a step closer to the Premier League title as the ruthless leaders swept to a 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday.Chelsea had to work hard to break down Everton’s stubborn resistence, but Pedro’s majestic second-half goal put the Blues on course for a fourth win in five games. Late goals from Gary Cahill and Willian wrapped up the victory as the Blues opened a seven-point lead at the top of the standings, piling pressure on second-place Tottenham ahead of its North London Derby against Arsenal later Sunday.Spurs won by 2-0 at White Hart Lane, but Chelsea’s steely display ensured the destiny of the title remains in its hands with four matches left: against Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion, Watford and Sunderland. Only West Brom, currently eighth, is in the top half of the league table.Chelsea need nine points to be assured of being crowned English champions in Manager Antonio Conte’s first season in charge.AdvertisementRestoring Pedro to the starting lineup Sunday in place of Cesc Fàbregas, Conte put the emphasis on attack, but the leaders were nearly caught cold at the back in the opening minutes.Dominic Calvert-Lewin wriggled free for a shot from a tight angle that deflected onto a post and rebounded to Romelu Lukaku, whose close-range strike was goalbound until Cahill came to the rescue with a last-ditch block.AdvertisementChelsea squandered a chance to take the lead when Diego Costa scampered away from the Everton defence and picked out Eden Hazard’s run.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
