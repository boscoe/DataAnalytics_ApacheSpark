PHILADELPHIA —  Soon after Jon Dorenbos’s mother was murdered by his father, he moved in with his aunt and returned to his hometown for a Little League all-star game where he witnessed his first magic show. Today, Dorenbos, the Philadelphia Eagles’ long snapper, says that 30-minute experience helped turn around his life.On Sunday, Dorenbos will finish his 13th N.F.L. season when the Eagles visit the Giants at MetLife Stadium. He is expected to play in his 149th consecutive game with the team, 13 short of Harold Carmichael’s franchise record. He has become an unlikely N.F.L. mainstay, given that he received no scholarship offers out of high school, was not selected in the N.F.L. draft and was placed on injured reserve and cut twice in his first four professional seasons. He also has developed into a highly regarded motivational speaker and magician who entertains crowds with his tricks and humor and inspires them with his personal story.In August 1992, Dorenbos was playing in his suburban Seattle neighborhood when he heard a bell ring, signaling him to come home. His father, Alan, said his mother, Kathy, had gone out with friends. The next morning, Dorenbos woke up for baseball camp and thought his mother had left for an early swim. At lunchtime, the parents of a friend picked him up and said there had been an emergency.When Dorenbos, who had turned 12 the month before, arrived at the police station, an officer who had taught him in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education elementary school program told him that his mother had died after his father pushed her down the stairs during an argument. The police then called Dorenbos’s older sister, Kristina, who was visiting their grandparents in California.“As you go through life, there’s certain things you’ll never forget,” Jon Dorenbos said. “I’ll never forget the scream on the phone when they told her. I’ll never forget that.”AdvertisementAfter Alan Dorenbos was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to more than 13 years in prison, Jon and Kristina (who also have an older brother) moved to Garden Grove, Calif., to live with an aunt, Susan Hindman, who was Kathy Dorenbos’s younger sister.AdvertisementHindman, who was 32 and single, made sure her niece and nephew were active. Jon won the lead role as Charlie Brown in a community theater production, remained involved in sports and dreamed of playing baseball at Pepperdine University. But it was magic that won his heart.Dorenbos saw his first show when he returned to Washington after his mother’s killing to participate in a baseball tournament. He stayed with his coach, whose teenage son performed a few tricks for him. When Dorenbos eagerly told his aunt about the performance, she put him in touch with her friend Ken Sands, a professional magician in Southern California. Sands taught Dorenbos a few secrets, but also about technique and style, and became his mentor and confidant.

I couldn’t believe how alive he was and how excited he was about learning magic and living life.”At first, Dorenbos preferred practicing alone. He sometimes put tape on his bedroom door to keep his aunt and sister out. Soon, though, he began performing at school talent shows and birthday parties. Sands remembers Dorenbos as a teenager, spending hours watching videos, learning card techniques and even memorizing the magician Lance Burton’s Las Vegas act. Dorenbos’s family always supported him, including his grandfather, who built props for his tricks.“When a 12- or 13-year-old says, ‘Hey, I want to be a magician,’ there’s probably some families that are like, ‘Nah, let’s go over here, you want to be a doctor,’ ” Dorenbos said. “But you know what? They loved it. They saw how happy it made me.”Around the same time, Dorenbos became passionate about football, which he started playing as a freshman at Pacifica High School. Although Dorenbos starred at linebacker and tight end, no top-tier programs recruited him, so he enrolled at Golden West College, a junior college in nearby Huntington Beach. A highlight tape attracted an offer from the University of Texas, El Paso, and by his senior season, in 2002, Dorenbos had developed into an N.F.L. prospect as a long snapper. When no team drafted him the next spring, he joined the Buffalo Bills, playing all 16 games in his rookie season and the first 13 games of 2004 before sustaining a knee injury.AdvertisementAfter playing nine games with the Tennessee Titans in 2005, Dorenbos faced the end of his career when he was not invited to any team’s training camp in 2006. He was considering getting into the entertainment industry full time until the Titans called again in October 2006.He lasted one game before being cut again, but the Eagles signed him in late November when their veteran long snapper, Mike Bartrum, sustained a neck injury. Dorenbos has been with Philadelphia ever since, playing every game and earning Pro Bowl spots after the 2009 and 2014 seasons.At the same time, Dorenbos has tried to make the most of his time away from the field. He mentors children in foster care, volunteers with organizations that help abused women and participates in campaigns fighting domestic violence and sexual assault. He also teaches magic tricks free of charge, and buys props for visitors to Sands’s shop.

He mostly does card tricks, but he says his main goal is to entertain.“I don’t need you to think I’m some god figure,” Dorenbos said. “I’m not trying to sell you on the spirits of anything. It’s cool. It’s fun. Let’s have a good time, let’s laugh, let’s have some energy and let’s call it a day.”Alan Dorenbos was released from prison in 2004, but Dorenbos and his sister have not spoken with him since confronting him in prison — at a therapist’s suggestion — shortly after his conviction. Still, Jon Dorenbos said he decided to forgive his father several years ago.“I had a guilt that if I forgave him, I’d be letting my mom down, like she’d be mad, like ‘How could you take his side?’ ” Dorenbos said. “It’s not about sides. Life’s about perception and life’s about how you view things.“The way I view things is, I think my mom would much rather me live a happy, productive life and help others. I forgave myself for that and moved on and forgave him. It’s the best thing I ever did.”A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2016, on Page SP5 of the New York edition with the headline: How a Magician Grew From a Darkest Memory .
