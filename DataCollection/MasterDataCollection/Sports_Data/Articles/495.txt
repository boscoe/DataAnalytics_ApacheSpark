Making a mock N.F.L. draft is not easy. Divining the intentions of 32 teams, evaluating scores of players, factoring in potential trades and coming up with a list of picks that makes sense tests the mettle of even the most informed fan or pundit.And it looks like this year’s mock drafts may bear even less resemblance to reality than usual. The problem starts almost at the top. Sure, pencil in Myles Garrett at No. 1, but then?“It’s been a long time since we’ve had a draft without a consensus No. 2,” said Robby Esch, the owner of the draft site The Huddle Report. “It could be anybody. Every team in the top five has said they’re willing to trade out. That will throw mock drafts.”There are also a number of players whose draft position is anybody’s guess.Walter Cherepinsky, the president of walterfootball.com, another draft site, said the question marks included “players who didn’t test very well and didn’t do well at the combine.”Advertisement“Mike Williams of Clemson could fall out of the first round, yet we know a team that’s going to consider him in the top 10,” he said.AdvertisementCherepinsky and Esch both say there is a great deal of uncertainty about players with character issues, like Joe Mixon, the Oklahoma running back who punched a woman in the face at a cafe.Reuben Foster of Alabama got kicked out of the combine after an altercation with a hospital worker, then was found to have a diluted drug sample. A former candidate to be drafted No. 2, he may now have fallen as far as No. 20. Good luck guessing his draft position.
                The scouting of football players has given rise to a new language. It's barely intelligible.            Medical exams at the combine found shoulder issues with another potential high pick from Alabama, defensive lineman Jonathan Allen. But how will it affect his draft position? Even the experts are not sure. “Any defensive coach would love to have him,” Esch said. “It depends how much teams weigh that in.”And there’s always the danger of something completely unexpected. No mock drafts last year accounted for a video emerging just as the draft started of highly touted Laremy Tunsil inhaling from a bong attached to a gas mask. He fell all the way to No. 13.In the face of so much uncertainty, knowing teams’ tendencies is the key to a good mock draft, Cherepinsky said. “The Falcons like athletic prospects. The Patriots and the Lions focus on three-cone times,” a quickness drill at the combine. “The Seahawks late in the draft go for home run picks,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

When The New York Times last looked at the mock draft phenomenon, it reported that in 2014, of 115 drafts evaluated by The Huddle Report, none had more than eight picks going to the right team in the first round. The good news is that “was the worst year for matches,” Esch said.Last year, 35 of 107 got at least eight right, and two selectors got 12 right.There doesn’t seem to be a simple answer to the improvement in mock performance. Esch credits the rookie salary cap for allowing teams to more readily select the player they most need, rather than the one who is most valuable.“What it did for mock drafters is, we had to change our process,” Esch said. “We used to put the high-dollar positions up high, but now I’m matching teams with players.” And that seems to be a little bit easier, judging by recent years’ mock drafts.AdvertisementBut Thursday night is looking like a return to the days of unpredictability. That could provide spice to a draft that’s a little low on marquee names.“It doesn’t seem like there’s as big a buzz about this draft class,” Esch said. “Good defensive draft, but people get excited about quarterbacks. Football coaches love this draft. Your die-hards will follow it.”Judging from the ratings, and the proliferation of mock drafts, there are millions of die-hards out there.A version of this article appears in print on April 26, 2017, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: One Certainty in Mock N.F.L.
