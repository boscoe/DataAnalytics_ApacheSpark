The viewership increase is being fueled in part by the long championship droughts of the teams.Audience size usually leaps significantly if a Game 6 or a Game 7 is played. In 2014, Game 7 between the San Francisco Giants and the Royals attracted an average of 23.5 million viewers, up nearly 10 million from Game 6. And after an average of 14.3 million watched Game 5 of the 2011 Series between the Texas Rangers and the Cardinals, 21.1 million tuned in to Game 6 and 25.4 million to Game 7.But it would require huge increases in viewership for Game 6 and, if necessary, Game 7 for this season’s Series to approach the 25.4 million average of 2004.As viewership for the World Series rises, the N.F.L.’s prime-time problems continue. The Dallas Cowboys’ 29-23 win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night was seen by an average of 18 million viewers on NBC, down 22 percent from the comparable game in 2015. It was in line with viewership for the last six Sunday night games that competed against World Series games.For the season, viewership for NBC’s games is down 18 percent.Advertisement
