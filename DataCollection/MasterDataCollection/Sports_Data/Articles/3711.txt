Wants to hit .300, he can hit .300. Wants to hit for power, he can hit for power. He’s the best player I’ve ever seen.”Mattingly, trim and tan in his new Miami Marlins uniform, shrugged under the Tuesday morning sun outside the clubhouse, the Yankees soon to arrive for the day’s exhibition.“Somebody tells you that, you start to pay attention,” he said.There was a relatively short period during those years before Mattingly’s back rebelled and aborted a likely Hall of Fame career when a convincing argument could be made that he and Bonds represented the very best of hitters in their respective leagues.But as the scandal-marred Bonds, having resurfaced in baseball this spring as Mattingly’s hitting coach with the Marlins, perceptively noted, those were different times, a generation preceding the connectivity of interleague play, social media, every major league home run and highlight deliverable to one’s smartphone.Across the leagues, there was more mystery among the stars, more curiosity, more grapevine gossip.“Donnie and I didn’t play against each other, we never crossed paths, other than maybe admiring each other on television and stuff,” Bonds said. “For the first couple of years, I was a young kid, not in Donnie’s class. He was doing his thing — we were all admiring him at that time — but I was just trying to carve my own path.”Now their paths have intersected, for starters, at Roger Dean Stadium, which the Marlins share as their spring home with the St. Louis Cardinals — who a half-dozen years ago brought the comparatively notorious Mark McGwire back into baseball in the same hitting coach position.On one level, the working union of Mattingly and Bonds — curiously arranged by the Marlins’ owner, Jeffrey Loria — would appear to be an eccentric study in character contrasts.Mattingly, still referred to adoringly as Donnie Baseball, may have committed no greater behavioral offense as a player than defying George Steinbrenner’s ban on facial hair, which Mattingly, amazingly enough, has adopted with the Marlins.Bonds’s record and records — from the single-season and career home run barrage during the peak of the steroids era to the prosecutorial aftermath — are an essential part of an eternal debate about an industrywide debacle. But Bonds has returned, the familiar No. 25 upon his back, even as Hall of Fame voters deny him what he had already earned before his body, now proportionally fit, swelled along with his late-career statistical power surge. Call this occurrence whatever you like — a paradox, a pretension, a pity — but Bonds says he has moved on, taking on the challenge of teacher.“That’s my role now,” he said. “I don’t even care about my career anymore. I let the guys know: ‘This is your time. I don’t play this game anymore.’ They’ll kid around and say, ‘I can outhit you,’ and I say: ‘Yeah, you better. I’m 51 years old. But if we were playing in the same time, that would be a different conversation, I can assure you that.’ ”Sitting in the shade of a batting cage, where he had just worked out a Marlins minor league prospect, Bonds let loose a hearty laugh, seemingly in a serene state of being.Conversely, it wasn’t yet 9 a.m. and he had been at the complex and on the field for almost two hours.“Long days for me,” he said. “I don’t know if I ever even stayed for a nine-inning spring training game in my life.”Bonds was born a child of major league privilege, the son of Bobby Bonds and later the prince of San Francisco, even when the rest of the country called him a pariah.The job description was part of the discussion Mattingly said he had with Bonds — the most significant part — when they met in New York soon after Mattingly was announced as the Marlins’ manager last fall after being fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers.“Jeffrey had Barry come in, we talked, about some of the things,” Mattingly said. “I knew the hitting part wasn’t going to be a problem. Then we just talked about the time that it took and his commitment to that. I just wanted him to understand about the time.“I think that will be Barry’s biggest adjustment — the opposing pitchers, time in the cage, that grind. People don’t realize how much time and preparation there is. You got 13 guys trying to get ready, somebody’s always a mess. It’s just a lot of time.”A couple of weeks in, Bonds said he was enjoying building relationships with the hitters, determining what they need from him, and the advantage of working with a manager “who also hit in baseball, because that’s what I did.”He added: “With Donnie and me it’s good because when you sit around and talk about hitting, we’re on the same page, actually can see things the same way.”Here’s how, mainly: Neither man is an enthusiastic promoter of the analytics approach. A preacher of balance and instinct, Bonds said: “I think you got a bunch of bookworm people who analyze too much and make it all too confusing to a lot of people. There’s just too much unnecessary information.”To which Mattingly said, “He’s very simple about it, the way he talks about hitting, and I like that.”How long will Bonds endure the grind? He wouldn’t hazard a guess. Again, the days are long.“I couldn’t see not giving it a try, being in the trenches,” Bonds said. “How long it lasts, who knows?”He stood up to leave the batting cage, And walk toward the bright morning sun.“Good luck with the season,” he was told.Without turning back, he said, referring to his hitters, “They need the luck, not me.” He chuckled and added, “I don’t have to deal with that pressure anymore.”Advertisement
