He was 86.His death was confirmed by his son Mark.Williams became the starting quarterback as a junior in 1949. Standing 6 feet 1 and weighing 190 pounds, he had a strong, accurate arm and was adept at picking the best plays from Notre Dame’s sizable arsenal.Under Frank Leahy, whose Irish became one of the most dominant college teams of the 1940s and early ’50s, and with the help of other star teammates like Leon Hart and Emil Sitko, Williams had a breakout season.He completed 83 of 147 passes for 1,374 yard and 16 touchdowns; carried the ball 34 times for 63 yards and one touchdown; and set a Notre Dame single-game completion percentage record by connecting on 13 of 16 passes against Michigan State. He also punted, averaging 39.3 yards per kick.AdvertisementWilliams was an all-American that year, along with his teammates Hart, Sitko and Jim Martin, and he finished fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy, which Hart won. The Irish went 10-0 that year, beating Southern Methodist University, 27-20, in their season finale on Dec. 3.

She died in 1998.After the season, he was drafted into the Navy. He returned to the Bears in 1955, then retired because he wanted to live with his family in Baltimore, his son said.
