After Yale’s players had celebrated with bearhugs and a scrum at center court, the Ivy League’s executive director, Robin Harris, told them, “I want to congratulate you on being outright champion.”She seemed to emphasize “outright” as she spoke, and that must have been reassuring for the Bulldogs. Last year, Yale lost its last game of the regular season and split the league title with Harvard, which then beat Yale in a one-game playoff to secure the league’s berth for the N.C.A.A. tournament.There was no equivocation Saturday night, though, as the Bulldogs won at Columbia, 71-55, leaving Harris to announce at the postgame trophy ceremony, “You’re going dancing.”Yale’s N.C.A.A. tournament spot is its first since 1962, ending what had been the second-longest drought in Division I (with the exception of five charter members that since 1948 have never made the tournament).AdvertisementSaturday’s victory capped a spectacular regular season in which the Bulldogs went 22-6 over all and 13-1 in the conference, even as their captain, Jack Montague, departed midseason for unspecified reasons.Advertisement“It’s over,” Greg Kelley, last season’s captain, who was in attendance, said of Yale’s long tournament absence. “We’re going. Felt cursed before, but it’s been lifted.”The sophomore point guard Makai Mason, who had hit a jumper on Feb. 27 against Dartmouth to force overtime in a crucial game Yale eventually won, led all players Saturday night with 22 points, collecting several of them off midrange runners that appeared unguardable. Yale shot better than 50 percent from the field and outrebounded Columbia, 39-24.Since early last month, the Bulldogs have been without Montague, a senior who was among the team’s leaders in assists and steals, and his absence has stirred intense speculation on Yale’s campus. Both he and Yale have said he is taking a leave of absence, but he has not returned, and last week his father told The New Haven Register that he had been expelled. (Yale would not confirm Montague’s status.)Last weekend, the team warmed up in shirts that bore the name Gucci, a nickname of Montague’s. The senior Justin Sears, who is likely to be named the Ivy League’s player of the year for the second straight season, told The Yale Daily News that the shirts were intended to convey “that Jack is one of our brothers.”After Saturday’s game, Sears told reporters that he had spoken with Montague by phone that day, adding: “He’s our leader; he’s our captain — he’s still our captain. He’s my brother; he’s all of our brothers.”Yale entered the game at a sold-out Levien Gymnasium able to take sole possession of the Ivy League title thanks to Princeton’s 73-71 loss at Harvard on Friday night. Saturday’s game, then, may have been the last regular-season contest in the Ivy League, or anywhere else, with direct and immediate implications for the N.C.A.A. tournament.Uniquely among Division I conferences, the Ivy League assigns its automatic bid to its regular-season champion. But there have been rumblings that the league could join the 31 other conferences and stage a championship tournament. Before Saturday’s game, Athletic Director Thomas Beckett of Yale spoke in favor of one, saying he hoped “to convince the league that a postseason tournament would be great for our students.”

Yale had more riding on the game than the Lions, who the night before had been eliminated from Ivy League contention. Columbia, which has not made the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1968, finished 21-10 over all and 10-4 in-conference.AdvertisementMaodo Lo, a senior guard sporting a sweet crossover, led the Lions with 21 points.Next up for Yale is a weeklong break and then, on March 13 — Selection Sunday — word of its destination. The Bulldogs entered Saturday’s game No. 52 in the N.C.A.A.’s rating percentage index and will most likely receive a high seed and a date with one of the major conferences’ major powers for its opening game of the tournament.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

When a scramble after a loose ball resulted in a foul against the Lions late in the first half, the fans berated the referees.Yale’s halftime lead of 41-27 reflected superior spacing by the Bulldogs on offense, which helped them go 6 for 11 from 3-point range, and some unlucky shots and unlucky calls for the Lions.Columbia, though, aided by its zone defense, stormed into the second half on an 18-8 run, capped by a 3-pointer by the freshman Lukas Meisner with less than 10 minutes left. Yale committed several sloppy turnovers. Had the crowd not been so loud, the questions of whether the Bulldogs would again fall short might have been audible.But James Jones — who has split the Ivy League title twice in his 17 seasons as Yale’s coach — called a timeout, and with Mason’s leadership, Yale resumed its feisty defense and displayed a more careful version of its drive-and-dish offense.Maintaining a single-digit lead, Yale did not so much finish as sputter to a halt. But this year, at least, that was enough for it to race into the postseason.An article in some editions last Sunday about Yale’s 71-55 victory over Columbia that secured the Ivy League men’s basketball championship misstated the game at which Yale’s Makai Mason hit a jump shot to force overtime in a crucial victory this season. It was on Feb. 27 against Dartmouth, not Feb. 26 against Harvard.A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2016, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yale Finally Has an Ivy Title to Call Its Own .
