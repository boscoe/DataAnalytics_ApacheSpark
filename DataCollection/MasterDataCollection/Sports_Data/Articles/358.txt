THE HAGUE —  A new Chinese owner arrived at the Dutch soccer club ADO Den Haag in early 2014, promising multimillion-dollar investments and better days ahead. Fans of the club liked the sound of that.Yes, the money to buy the team arrived a few months late, but it did arrive in the end, along with firm deadlines for further investments and a handful of new signings. Even if the most ardent fans were wary of the new owner’s intentions, they held their tongues.ADO, a 110-year-old club, has not won the top Dutch league, now known as the Eredivisie, since the end of World War II. But the new owner, a wealthy businessman named Wang Hui, promised to turn the team into a powerhouse — one that could challenge the likes of Ajax, P.S.V. Eindhoven and Feyenoord, clubs that have long dominated Dutch soccer, and play well enough to qualify for top European competitions like the Champions League.Wang seemed like fun, cheering wildly for goals from his box at ADO’s Kyocera Stadium and throwing up his hands in disbelief whenever the team conceded a penalty. At least once, he even took part in a practice session with the players.Advertisement“Wang was very enthusiastic,” said Jacco van Leeuwen, the chairman of the club’s fan association. “He promised European football, so everyone was very happy with him. We showed a banner with Wang on it.”AdvertisementBut 18 months later, the supporters’ patience is wearing thin. ADO Den Haag is mired in the middle of the Dutch standings, the flashy signings have stopped, and Wang has missed several deadlines to make payments he promised. Some at the club fear that Wang, who spent millions to buy the club and pledged millions more to improve it, has lost interest in it.Wang, in an interview in his Beijing office, said he was merely recalculating his strategy, but he also pointedly said that he was under no obligation to do more than he had.“After I pay the takeover, the club is mine,” he said. “It is my business in terms of how much I will invest in the club.”That change in attitude may not go over well in The Hague. While ADO supporters collected food and supplies to be distributed to the local poor in the weeks before Christmas, they also have a fearsome history. (In the 1980s, they were even accused of setting fire to their own stadium, the Zuiderpark.) And to people from The Hague, words — and actions — matter.“In Den Haag, the character of the people is that when you don’t like it, you say it directly; you don’t hide,” van Leeuwen said. “So we have a rough reputation.”Promise, Then UncertaintyADO Den Haag is the only major soccer club in The Hague, a coastal city and the seat of government in the Netherlands. ADO Den Haag — in Dutch, ADO is an acronym for “everything through practice” — came to represent the city’s large working-class population. The club enjoyed little success in the postwar era and instead gained notoriety for a following that included some of Europe’s toughest hooligans.“It was always a midtable club, but a good club, good young players coming from The Hague,” said Dick Advocaat, a former coach of the Dutch national team who began his playing career at ADO.AdvertisementDespite the large sums of Asian money that have been invested in European soccer — including a recent $400 million Chinese investment in Manchester City, a club bought by the royal family of Abu Dhabi in 2008 — few expected ADO Den Haag to be ready to join Europe’s elite.Enter Wang, a wealthy, Beijing-based businessman whose marketing company, United Vansen International Sports, helped organize the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Last year, he bought a 98 percent stake in ADO for a reported $8.9 million and announced his intention to take the club into European competition while sending Dutch coaches from the club to China to improve young players there.“At the time, we had a clear preference this was sold to local businessmen,” said Tom de Bruijn, a politician who sits on The Hague’s municipal executive committee and was close to the deal.The municipality owns Kyocera Stadium and had a so-called golden share in the club, meaning it could block any purchase on one condition: that the club find another buyer willing to pay the same price for the shares.But no local investors came forward, and after verifying that Wang’s finances were legitimate, the club was sold.“I had a good impression when I spoke to him,” de Bruijn said.Despite the agreement, it took months for the money to materialize. When it did, a period of optimism followed. Further investments were made, and expensive new players were acquired, including the Dutch-Japanese striker Mike Havenaar, and Wang was seen at several matches. When the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, visited China with a trade delegation, Wang presented him with a green and gold ADO shirt. (Rutte took it with good humor when he noticed his name was written as “Rutten” on the back.)

While a handful of ADO coaches went to Beijing to coach at the former school of China’s president, Xi Jinping, an avid soccer fan, the former Chinese national team coach Gao Hongbo was unveiled as an ADO assistant coach. Gao’s move soon caused tension: After every game, ADO’s incumbent coach, Henk Fraser, was asked by reporters whether he was about to be replaced.“To be honest, I spoke to him occasionally,” Fraser said of Gao. “But he is not part of my training staff.”AdvertisementFraser added: “He was here to get the Dutch way of working. Most of the time, he was upstairs in one of the units watching the way we train.”When Fraser was asked about Wang, the club ended the interview.The greatest tensions, though, were related to finances. Deadlines for Wang to make a further $4.1 million investment in the club in September and November were missed. More important, the club was forced to admit that it had not been able to speak with Wang.A third deadline, Dec. 18, had been agreed upon for the money, shortly after a league match against Willem II, but that, too, passed without payment.The uncertainty has left many people in the city unhappy, not least Advocaat, who had called for the Chinese influence in ADO to come to an end.“He had some good ideas, but you’ve got to do it,” said Advocaat, who acknowledged that he had discussed taking an advisory role at the club with Wang. “But now he is not paying the money. That is why I said people from Den Haag should take over.”Offering Assurances On the 22nd floor of a building in downtown Beijing, Wang keeps a small green and yellow ADO Den Haag pennant pinned to his bookcase. He was not hard to locate, and he quickly agreed to an interview.Wang maintained that his plans for revitalizing ADO remain unchanged. He promised that he still had the best intentions for the club and that the $4.1 million would be paid.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

You can offer suggestions. But now the circumstances are different, and I need to adjust my strategy.”When asked specifically about the missed payments, Wang said the money was “not a promise because I don’t need to promise anything to anyone in terms of investing more money into my own club.”He added, “But as long as you want to do better and you don’t have enough money to do so, of course I’m willing to help.”Back in The Hague, there were no banners or chants against Wang in the stands before Dutch soccer’s holiday break. Before the game against Willem II, van Leeuwen, on behalf of the supporters, wrote an open letter to Wang asking for a meeting and promising that the fans would give Wang time to prove his intentions.“Now everyone is very quiet because you can say everything about the Chinese but then you make him angry,” van Leeuwen said.Still, the Dec. 18 deadline came and went. The money was not paid, and Wang did not visit the club, saying he had canceled because of an important meeting with the Chinese Football Association. A spokesman for the club said Sunday that the money had not arrived but that the club was hopeful it would on Tuesday.The spokesman, who said the club hoped Wang might come in January, also said that he “had seen documents that prove the money is on the way — that has rebuilt trust.”The holiday break is giving ADO time to sort out the situation, but the fans will not wait forever. The first game after the break, on Jan. 17, will be the biggest derby of ADO’s season, against first-place Ajax.Advertisement“If the money isn’t there by then, I think you will see banners,” van Leeuwen said. “And then there will be a problem.”Adam Wu contributed reporting from Beijing, and Mitra Nazar from Utrecht, the Netherlands.A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2016, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Foreign Owner, Local Discontent.
