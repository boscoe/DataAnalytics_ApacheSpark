Given its anachronistic character, it’s also an event that, were it not for its illustrious history and its continuing ability to attract heads of state, movie stars, entrepreneurs and executives of the world’s biggest companies, would certainly no longer exist.So what exactly sets the Monaco race and track apart, and what effect does the location have on just about everyone involved: the drivers, the spectators, the mechanics working on the cars?Because of the Monaco track’s unusual characteristics, probably no other track on the Formula One calendar better illustrates the intricate relationship of cars, drivers, fans and circuit.To maintain the Monaco jewel in its elite racing crown, Formula One, with the local organizers, has made huge efforts over the years to accommodate a constantly growing and transforming racing series within the confines of a virtually unchanging city circuit. The track layout has barely changed since it was first featured on the Formula One calendar in 1950, and even since the first running of a Grand Prix in Monaco, in 1929.At just 2.07 miles in length, with the surrounding walls close to the cars and the bumpy, slippery surface of the track, Monaco is the most challenging circuit of the season, even if it is the slowest and shortest track.“A lap around this circuit requires inch-perfect positioning of the car at every corner — each of which leaves no room for error,” said Paddy Lowe, the technical director of the Mercedes team.“It’s a track where driver skill very much comes to the fore,” he added, “although, as always, the team plays a crucial role in ensuring the car is adapted to the specific demands of the circuit and gives the driver confidence to find the limits.”The pit lane and garage area for Sunday’s race were recently renovated to give the mechanics more room to work, but the Monaco track’s work area still remains the smallest in the series.“It’s a bit more challenging, as everything is a lot tighter — the garages are small, the offices are tight, the tires are kept at the back, and everything is narrow,” said Nick Chester, technical director of the Renault team. “But it isn’t that bad in reality, compared to years ago, when we used to work at the harbor and move the cars and all the kit into the pit lane for each session.“So yes, the venue is different to anywhere else, but we are well used to it,” he said.The drivers must drive to within millimeters of the walls and other trackside limits and barriers to attain fast lap times. Even the slightest error can result in an accident.The track is not a challenge just for drivers. The engineers must make changes to the car that are specific to Monaco.For example, the narrow hairpin curve known as Loews turns back on itself at almost 180 degrees. So engineers must increase the steering angle of the car to allow it to make that turn.In terms of aerodynamics, the Monaco track requires a greater amount of downforce than any other. The teams therefore create special wings that are used only for the Monaco circuit. Without them, the cars could not compete.Because the cars need considerable grip on the street track, there is no debate about which tires to use: The Pirelli tire manufacturer provides the teams with the softest version.And because of the bumpy surface of the track, the car’s suspension has to be set much softer than at other circuits to absorb the shocks.One of the greatest paradoxes of the Monaco circuit is that while it may be the slowest of the year, for the drivers it feels extremely fast, because they race so close to the side barriers on narrow streets. For the spectators, too, the proximity of the cars to the grandstands can make it seem as if the cars are faster than at any other circuit.Another paradox is that even though Monaco is the circuit where it is most difficult for drivers to pass one another, because of the narrowness of the track in the urban confines, there is almost always some kind of racing excitement, usually a result of an accident caused by a driver’s error.“Racing at Monaco is an incredible challenge,” said Jenson Button, who drives for the McLaren team. “Being precise on turn-in, hitting the apex and balancing the throttle, while being as patient as possible to get the best exit, is a real art.”He added, “Monaco always produces great drama, which just adds to its legendary status as one of the best Grands Prix on the calendar.”Advertisement
