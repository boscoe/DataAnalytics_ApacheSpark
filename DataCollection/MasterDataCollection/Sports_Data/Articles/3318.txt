School superintendents in Texas overwhelmingly approved a change that requires public school officials to use a birth certificate to determine a student-athlete’s gender. In a referendum ballot submitted to superintendents last month, they voted by 586 to 32 to amend University Interscholastic League rules when it comes to transgender athletes.The group is the state’s governing body for high school sports. Its policy director, Jamey Harrison, told The Dallas Morning News that the change codified the advice the league had been giving superintendents. The amendment goes into effect Aug. 1. It does allow other government documents to be used for the purpose of identification if a birth certificate is unavailable.Advocates for transgender people condemned the move, saying it would force transgender students to amend their birth certificates, a costly process, in order to play. Chris Mosier, the founder of TransAthlete.com, told The Texas Observer that the policy would deny transgender athletes an “equal opportunity to sports.”A version of this brief appears in print on February 28, 2016, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Rule on Transgender Athletes Is Amended.
