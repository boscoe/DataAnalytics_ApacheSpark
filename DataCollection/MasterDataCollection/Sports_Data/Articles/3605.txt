Zac Blair was disqualified from the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., after hitting himself in the head with his putter — and then using the bent club to finish out the hole. Blair smacked himself after missing a birdie putt. He was disqualified for breaking rule 4-3b, which stipulates if “a player’s club is damaged other than in the normal course of play rendering it nonconforming or changing its playing characteristics, the club must not subsequently be used or replayed during the round.” Blair, 25, was seven over par for the tournament when he was disqualified and would have faced an uphill battle to make the cut.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
