OAKLAND, Calif. — Kevin Durant’s first touch after he missed 19 games with a knee injury was a driving baseline reverse and emphatic one-handed slam. He triumphantly returned Saturday to finish with 16 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists as the Golden State Warriors beat the undermanned New Orleans Pelicans, 123-101.Durant had not played since getting hurt Feb. 28 at Washington. With Stephen Curry, the two-time reigning most valuable player, sidelined by a bruised left knee, the Warriors won their 14th straight game — the longest unbeaten run in the N.B.A. this season.Klay Thompson scored 20 points, Draymond Green had 13 points and 8 rebounds, and the do-everything Warriors look poised for another deep playoff run.Quinn Cook scored 22 points off the bench to lead New Orleans, which was missing DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis, Omer Asik, E’Twaun Moore and Quincy Pondexter.AdvertisementWhen Durant took the court before tipoff, he raised both hands to the sky. His shot was not quite as consistent as usual — he was 6 for 15 and missed all four 3-point tries in 31 minutes — as he tries to ease his way back to top form after a long layoff.Just by being back in the lineup, Durant gave everybody a lift. He had an assist to Zaza Pachulia on Golden State’s second possession and even brought the ball upcourt on occasion.AdvertisementShaun Livingston started for Curry and had 14 points and 6 assists. Andre Iguodala added 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
