Taking advantage of a rare day off for LeBron James, the Washington Wizards got a much-needed victory in their bid to move into playoff position, beating the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers, 113-99, on Sunday behind John Wall’s 21 points, 13 assists and 7 rebounds.Attacking from the start, Wall made 8 of 11 shots and came out on top in his matchup against the opposing point guard Kyrie Irving, who wound up with 28 points and 6 assists on 9-of-20 shooting.At one point late in the third quarter, Wall had the same number of assists as the Cavaliers team, 12, and he sat out the fourth quarter.It was the second consecutive loss for Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland, which is in a stretch of three games in four days. That busy schedule was one of the reasons Coach Tyronn Lue gave for resting James, who had skipped only one other game this season, on Dec. 5 at Miami.Advertisement“It kind of lets the guys down a little bit,” Lue said of the move to rest James. “But that’s a decision that we made.”Already ahead by 9 at halftime, the Wizards broke things open with a 9-0 run to start the second half, taking a 72-54 lead on a 3-pointer by Otto Porter Jr., who finished with 21 points. When Porter and Wall then made consecutive 3-pointers, Washington’s margin grew to 25 points at 88-63 with under five minutes remaining in the third quarter, and that was pretty much that.The Cavaliers are 41-17 and two games ahead of Toronto for the top spot in the East; the Wizards are 28-30 and 10th in the conference, two games out of the eighth and final playoff berth.Washington led by 35-28 after the first quarter and by 63-54 at halftime en route to a season-high fifth straight victory at home.PISTONS 114, RAPTORS 101 Andre Drummond had 15 points and 18 rebounds, and Detroit took advantage of Kyle Lowry’s absence to beat visiting Toronto.AdvertisementLowry sat out for the first time all season because the Raptors wanted to rest him after a 43-point performance against Cleveland on Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
