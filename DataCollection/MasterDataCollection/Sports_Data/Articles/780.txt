Pat Haden, who won two national championships as a quarterback at Southern California before returning nearly four decades later to preside over an athletic department mired in pay-for-play-related sanctions, will step down as the Trojans’ athletic director in June, the university president, C.L. Max Nikias, announced Friday.In a letter posted on U.S.C.’s website, Nikias praised Haden for “his distinct blend of integrity, energy, wisdom and character” and said that Haden had been a formidable fund-raiser as well as a valuable steward of U.S.C.’s storied football program.

When Haden took over in 2010, N.C.A.A. sanctions appeared to have decimated the football program, which in the previous decade had claimed two national titles and produced three Heisman Trophy winners under Coach Pete Carroll. The sanctions included a two-year bowl ban and several reductions in scholarships (plus the stripping of those national titles and the revocation of Reggie Bush’s Heisman).Since Haden took over, the football team has not been a model of stability. He has fired two coaches midseason, including in October, when he parted ways with Steve Sarkisian after widespread reports that Sakisian, in his second year as head coach, was struggling with substance abuse issues.Perhaps the most lasting accomplishment of Haden’s tenure was U.S.C.’s securing a 98-year lease to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on terms widely seen as favorable to the university. Nikias said Haden would stay on for a year in a role focused on fund-raising for the Coliseum.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2016, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | College Football; U.S.C.’s Haden to Step Down.
