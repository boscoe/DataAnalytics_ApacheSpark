Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 10 here.The Patriots were supposed to give the rest of the N.F.L. a head start while quarterback Tom Brady spent the first four weeks of the season in a timeout corner.Well, the 2016 season is halfway spent, and New England is imperiously looking down, from a 7-1 perch, at the bog of mediocrity that has swallowed most of its would-be peers.Brady has been in ruthlessly vintage form, completing 73.1 percent of his passes. The defense is so impregnable that the Patriots confidently dispatched an All-Pro linebacker, Jamie Collins, to Cleveland at the trading deadline, accepting a middle-round draft pick, just so they could dodge Collins’s demands as a free agent in the off-season.In the second act of this Freed Brady campaign, will anyone slow down the Pats? This weekend brings a critical test: They host the Seahawks in a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX.AdvertisementHere is a look at Sunday’s matchups and who we think will win them:8:30 p.m. Line: Patriots by 7 ½ The Seahawks are 21 months removed from their Super Bowl loss to the Patriots, and what they would give to have Marshawn Lynch out of retirement and in their backfield. They might bypass him on the game’s deciding play all over again, but that is beside the point. Without Lynch, the Seahawks are a lot less likely to have another chance to win in the final minute.AdvertisementSeattle ranks 25th in time of possession, leaving its defense to wilt from overexposure to even the milder elements (see 30 first downs granted to the Bills last week). Quarterback Russell Wilson can do only so much with his collection of injuries (knee, pectoral muscle). The Seahawks’ offense needs a running game to provide breathing intervals, but 75.4 rushing yards per game gets you little besides oxygen debt and bragging rights over the Vikings and the Giants, the only teams ranked below Seattle in the ground game.Confiscating a few turnovers could compensate. But good luck with that against Brady, head of a New England triune quarterback panel that has not thrown an interception in its first 249 throws of the season. Only the 1960 Browns have opened a season with nine interception-free games, and that was because they made only 264 pass attempts all year between Jim Brown carries.Pick: Patriots1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 3Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith is back after a week in the concussion protocol, glad to still have a job after tight end Travis Kelce showed that he, too, has a pro-caliber arm. (See YouTube for his spiraling towel toss at an official last week.)The Chiefs have kind of become a big deal without making much of a show of it. In the top-heavy A.F.C. West, with the Raiders (7-2) and the Broncos (6-3), Kansas City has won four straight. The binge continues a trend: The Chiefs have won 16 of their last 18 regular-season games.Stack that against a Panthers team that has won 15 of 17 at home. Carolina wants to unlock the N.F.C. South basement door with a third straight win, and thinks it can still make the playoffs. The holdovers from the 2015 Chiefs will not argue: That team started at 1-5, too, and reached the postseason.Pick: Chiefs1 p.m. Line: Jaguars by 1 ½When quarterback Brock Osweiler said that signing with the Texans gave him the best chance to succeed, he must have been referring to these semiannual galas with Jacksonville. We should mention that Osweiler’s Texans hold first place in the A.F.C. South despite three losses; his former team, Denver, also has three losses but sits in third in its division.A first road win of the season would be a great way for Houston to start looking like more than a default division leader. A first Texans takeaway outside Houston would help the cause.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard scoring formats and will be updated each week.            For that matter, any turnover in this matchup would be refreshing. The Jaguars have not forcibly taken the ball away from an opponent in 19 quarters, which is the short answer to how one ranks worst in turnover ratio in the N.F.L.AdvertisementThis game’s starting quarterbacks have a combined 19 interceptions. Something is going to give.Pick: Jaguars1 p.m. Line: Saints by 3Saints quarterback Drew Brees is the leading passer in the league, at 336.1 yards per paycheck, but why risk life and limb with Denver linebacker Von Miller turning the corner at full rage? The best route through the Broncos’ defense is the rushing lanes, where the defending Super Bowl champions gave up 218 yards to Oakland last weekend.Brees does not have to out-throw Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian — he can do that left-handed, in the snow, uphill. Brees just has to hand the ball off to Mark Ingram or Tim Hightower, who led the Saints to 248 rushing yards against San Francisco, a record in Sean Payton’s coaching tenure in New Orleans. Brees can save his arm for play-action heaves and third downs.Pick: Saints1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 2The Eagles’ four losses, all on the road, have come by a total of 19 points. If they are to stay unbeaten at their stadium, they must solve a Falcons team that has won four of its five road games.Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones is a 30-yard reception short of 1,000 yards. Yet cutting him off does little to slow the Falcons. Quarterback Matt Ryan has distributed two-thirds of his passing yards to other people, which is why the Falcons lead the N.F.L. in scoring with 33.9 points per game.Pick: Eagles1 p.m. Line: Jets by 1 ½Behold the Hot Seat Bowl, in which Rams Coach Jeff Fisher and his Jets counterpart, Todd Bowles, must rely on unreliable quarterbacks to keep them employed.Bowles has said Ryan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback if his injured knee holds up, even if two good Fitzpatrick knees have produced the N.F.L.’s last-place quarterback rating and 13 interceptions. This seems to be as good a time as any to see what the backup Bryce Petty has to offer. Problem is, if Petty does not play as if he has a future with the Jets, Bowles will not have one, either.AdvertisementThe Rams are sticking with Case Keenum, a placeholder for Jared Goff, this year’s No. 1 overall draft pick — whom Fisher seems in no hurry to promote.Pick: Jets1 p.m. Line: Chicago by 2The Bears are winless on the road. The Buccaneers are winless at home. The N.F.L. may be due for another tie.Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler returned last week from a thumb injury, but the Bears’ real hope lies in running back Jordan Howard, who is more than halfway to a 1,000-yard rookie season. The only other Bears rookie to rush for quadruple digits was the running back Howard replaced: Matt Forte.Pick: Bears1 p.m. Line: Packers by 2 ½Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota is why Tennessee is in the A.F.C. South hunt, and also why Tennessee is not leading the chase. He has thrown 17 touchdown passes while trending toward a 3,900-yard passing season. He has also thrown eight interceptions, and committed five turnovers that were returned for touchdowns.The Titans need him to be Good Marcus against the Packers, because there will be limited alternatives against Green Bay’s No. 1 rushing defense.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

With two straight losses, and no more home games until December, McCarthy will whip his Packers back into postseason shape.Pick: Packers1 p.m. Line: Redskins by 2 ½Gravity has kicked in, because all laws must eventually be obeyed, pulling the Vikings to where everyone assumed they would be when quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and running back Adrian Peterson took medical leaves before Week 3.Minnesota still leads the N.F.C. North after three straight losses, but the Vikings are likely to keep sinking under the dead weight of their offense, the league’s worst in total yardage.AdvertisementBut then, no one allows fewer points per game than the Vikings. Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins must hack that firewall without the protection of the Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams, who will sit out a month for an unspecified violation of the league’s substance abuse rules.Pick: Redskins4:05 p.m. Line: Chicago by 2Remember when these teams were 1-4, elbowing their way to prime draft position?San Diego has surged to match its 2015 win total in just nine games, and it did so without quarterback Philip Rivers as its guiding force. That distinction belongs to running back Melvin Gordon, who just became the first Charger to gain 196 yards from scrimmage since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2002.Gordon’s 11 touchdowns lead the league. With Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi aiming for his fourth straight game over 100 yards, this run-blasted matchup might be over before some of the morning games.Pick: Chargers4:25 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 13 ½Arizona is a shell of its 2015 self, and San Francisco, under Coach Chip Kelly, has fans longing for the Jim Tomsula era.The 49ers’ defense has acquiesced to a 100-yard rusher for an N.F.L.-record seven consecutive games, and the Cardinals cannot wait to see 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick again. Last time he went to the desert, in the third week of the 2015 season, Kaepernick threw four interceptions, two of them for touchdowns.Pick: Cardinals4:25 p.m. Line: Steelers by 2 ½Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo has officially returned to the roster from a preseason back injury, and he must be aching to take charge of one of the most talented Dallas teams in years.But for this week, Romo is unlikely to reclaim the starting job from his rookie replacement, Dak Prescott.Under Prescott, the Cowboys have beaten seven straight teams since a 1-point loss to the Giants in the opener. But none of those seven have a winning record today.AdvertisementPick: CowboysAll times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.A version of this article appears in print on November 13, 2016, on Page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: To Stoke Fiery Start, Add Rematch.
