I will be back strong and fast again.”Ligety, 32, who said he was having a microdiscectomy, a procedure typically performed on herniated disks, was already coming back from another serious injury, a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament that he sustained in training last January.Ligety, an American who dominated the giant slalom competition in recent years, has been dealing with disk problems in his back. And his results have declined recently: After finishing fifth in the season-opening giant slalom, he finished 29th and 11th, then did not finish his last two races.Advertisement
