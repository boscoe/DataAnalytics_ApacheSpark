He will not participate in any baseball activities for two weeks and then will be examined further. He is expected to be out for about six weeks, said Cashman, speaking to reporters in Tampa, Fla.Cashman said his staff had had a long meeting about how to replace Gregorius. The options are likely to come from within the organization, but they will not include Gleyber Torres, the Yankees’ top prospect, who is having a torrid spring but is only 20 and has not played above Class A. He was assigned to Class AA on Tuesday.Among the candidates are second baseman Starlin Castro, who was a longtime shortstop for the Chicago Cubs; the utility player Ronald Torreyes; and Ruben Tejada and Pete Kozma, both of whom are signed to minor league contracts. Tyler Wade, who has not played above Class AA, will also be considered.Gregorius, who returned to Tampa on Monday from Los Angeles, where the Netherlands lost to Puerto Rico in a W.B.C. semifinal Monday night, was examined by a Yankees doctor Tuesday morning. Gregorius was injured while trying to turn a double play as a second baseman.Gregorius, 27, was a rare bright spot in the Yankees’ desultory 2016 season. He hit .276 with a career-high 20 home runs and 70 runs batted in and appeared to have established himself as a central figure in the team’s rebuilding effort. The Yankees open the season April 2 at Tampa Bay.Advertisement
