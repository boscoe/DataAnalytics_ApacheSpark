NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. —  Once the final cord of the net was cut and the final picture was taken to commemorate Iona’s triumph in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference men’s basketball tournament, Iona Coach Tim Cluess went looking to congratulate Billi Godsey.A few hours before the Iona men’s team (22-10) won the MAAC tournament title (its league-record ninth) on March 7, earning an automatic berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Godsey and the Iona women’s team (23-11) had matched the feat. It was the first conference title, and the first N.C.A.A. berth, for the program since its inception in 1974.At least a dozen universities will send their men’s and women’s teams to the N.C.A.A. tournaments this season. Still, an achievement that has become the norm at places like UConn, Oklahoma and Maryland feels a bit more remarkable at a place like Iona.“It’s so hard for one team to make it, let alone two, especially in a conference our size,” Cluess said.AdvertisementFor Cluess and Godsey, that made last Monday twice as sweet. They understand better than most the challenges midmajor programs face in facilities, recruiting and financing when competing against major conferences for players as well as victories.
                Kansas, North Carolina, Virginia and Oregon are the top seeds in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament.            “I think it’s an incredible accomplishment,” said Rick Cole Jr., who is in his third year as Iona’s athletic director, adding: “You can find excuses or you can find ways to succeed. How do you want to spend your energy?”AdvertisementFor decades, enthusiasm and energy at Iona, a private Catholic liberal arts college with an enrollment of about 3,800, revolved around the men’s program. Jim Valvano, as energetic and charismatic as they come, helped to place Iona on the national stage from 1975 to 1980, and many his successors fed off of his creation.The women’s program provided a stark contrast. While the Gaels men have made 11 N.C.A.A. tournament trips, the women’s team finished without a winning record every season from 1982-83 until 2005-6. Coaches came and went, but success never arrived.“The presidents would always wonder why we didn’t do much better,” said Richard Petriccione, Iona’s athletic director from 1989 to 2001. “But other than that, there wasn’t a sense of urgency to get the program to the point where we would be very competitive as opposed to just putting out a team.”He added: “The biggest difference I see today, which is really great, is that the student-athlete experience for the men’s and women’s teams is, for the most part, equal, if not absolutely equal. That was different in those days. Budgets were different, the way teams traveled was different, recruiting budgets were different.”Cole emphasized Iona’s desire to do more than comply with opportunity required by Title IX, saying, “Women’s basketball matters to Iona.” Godsey, in her third year, credits her team’s long-awaited breakthrough to that administrative support.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Marina Lizarazu, a junior guard and a key figure on this year’s team, readily downsized in transferring to Iona after her freshman year at Texas Tech.Advertisement“I was looking for a different kind of environment, and Iona is next to the best city in the world,” said Lizarazu, who is from Madrid. “I love all the people. I love all my teammates.”Godsey, who holds a master’s degree in psychology, also tries to turn Iona’s small size to its advantage by working to create a family atmosphere. Aaliyah Robinson, a senior guard, said of Godsey, “I feel like one of her daughters.”Referring to what bigger programs can offer, Godsey said: “That facility is not going to love you back. You can get in that gym and shoot all you want, but it’s people who are going to take care of you.”Godsey is so intent on achieving the right chemistry that she acknowledges scrutinizing the parents of recruits before recruiting them. “We see how they cheer for players or against players and see the manner in which they interact in general,” she said, “because we want good people.”Stylistically, Godsey emphasizes defense. Her team ranks 38th nationally, allowing 56.6 points a game. Cluess’s 22-10 squad, by contrast, is built around a high-powered offense that ranks 31st at 79.6 points a game.Now those paths are finally converging in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The women’s team, a 15th seed in the Lexington Region, was matched against No. 2-seeded Maryland in the first round Saturday in College Park, Md. The men’s team, seeded 13th in the Midwest Region, is off to Denver, where it will face Iowa State (21-11) on Thursday.A version of this article appears in print on March 15, 2016, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: With Two Bids, Iona Savors ‘Incredible Accomplishment’.
