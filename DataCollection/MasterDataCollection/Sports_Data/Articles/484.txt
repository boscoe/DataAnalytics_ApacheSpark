Tony Romo has ended the Dallas Cowboys’ quarterback controversy with a concession speech.In one of the more graceful moves by a professional athlete whose starting job was threatened, Romo, who has been the Cowboys’ starting quarterback since 2006, acknowledged on Tuesday that Dak Prescott deserved to continue as the starter when Romo returns from injury.Romo has been working his way back from a back injury sustained during the preseason, and the Cowboys had insisted that he would not lose his job because of injury. But Romo avoided the usual drama surrounding such situations by saying in a prepared statement that he believed that Prescott had surpassed him on the depth chart.“Dak Prescott, and what he’s done, he’s earned the right to be our quarterback,” Romo said. “As hard as that is for me to say, he’s earned that right. He’s guided our team to an 8-1 record, and that’s hard to do.”While Romo is a four-time Pro Bowler with a 78-49 career record as a starter, he managed just four games last season because of injuries to his collarbone and at 36 years old it has not been clear how effectively he could return from having suffered a compression fracture in his back.AdvertisementIn his absence, Prescott, a rookie drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State, has teamed with his fellow rookie, Ezekiel Elliott, to lead the Cowboys to eight consecutive victories and the best record in the N.F.L.AdvertisementPrescott has drawn praise for his presence on the field, his accuracy on deep throws, and his ability to exploit the threat of Elliott’s running ability to make play-action passes particularly effective.After the duo led Dallas to a dramatic come-from-behind victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Elliott called Prescott a beast in a televised interview and discussed his leadership on the game-winning drive.“I looked at him before the drive and said, ‘Dak, this is why we’re here. This is why we came to Dallas,’” Elliott said. “He didn’t flinch.”For much of the season the Cowboys had insisted that Romo would return to his starting role, but Prescott’s play during the winning streak, which included wins on the road in Green Bay and Pittsburgh, forced the issue.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But in his remarks, Romo acknowledged that he had no plans to retire even if the Cowboys now belong to Prescott.“If you think for a second I don’t want to be out there, then you probably never felt the pure ecstasy of competing and winning,” Romo said. “That hasn’t left me. In fact, it may burn now more than ever.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
