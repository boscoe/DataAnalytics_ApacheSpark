For his historic trip to Cuba, President Obama took two guests sure to make a strong connection with baseball-crazed fans on the island: Rachel Robinson, the widow of Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in the major leagues, and the Robinsons’ daughter, Sharon.They join several other notable baseball figures also in Cuba for the visit, including Derek Jeter, the former Yankees captain; Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager who is now a top Major League Baseball executive; and Commissioner Rob Manfred.All are expected to be at an exhibition game Tuesday between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team in the Estadio Latinoamericano, where Jackie Robinson once played.Robinson is admired in Cuba not just for his baseball prowess and his advocacy of civil rights but also for the time he spent in Havana in 1947 during spring training before his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Many Cuban fans of African descent particularly identify with him.AdvertisementCubans seem to forget, or forgive, the anti-Communist views he espoused after retiring from baseball in 1956.AdvertisementIn an open letter to Fidel Castro published as a column in The New York Post in 1960, Robinson wrote that the Cuban leader “should stop now to see where he is going rather than continue to plunge along blindly.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
