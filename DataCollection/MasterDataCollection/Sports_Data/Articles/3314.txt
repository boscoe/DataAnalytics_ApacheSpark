A Carnival Cruise Line ship that was hosting a tour centered on Pittsburgh sports has rescued 16 migrants in the Gulf of Mexico. The Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said the Carnival Sensation found the 15 men and one woman about 50 miles north of Cuba and took them aboard. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jon-Paul Rios said they would be turned over to Mexican immigration officials at the ship’s next stop, Cozumel. He did not know their condition but said no medical help was requested. The rescue received wide notice when the former Steelers linebacker James Harrison posted rescue photos online. Other former Pittsburgh athletes said to be on the cruise include Steelers running back Rocky Bleier, Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen and Penguins center Bryan Trottier.A version of this brief appears in print on February 28, 2016, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ship With Pittsburgh Athletes Saves Migrants.
