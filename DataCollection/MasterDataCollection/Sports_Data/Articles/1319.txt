ST. LOUIS — Bartolo Colon, a favorite of Mets fans during his three seasons in New York, reached a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins on Friday.The Mets had expressed interest in a possible reunion with Colon through a conversation with his agent on Thursday, but several other teams also wanted him.Colon signed a one-year, $12.5 million deal in the off-season with the Atlanta Braves, who gave him a guaranteed spot in the rotation, something the pitching-deep Mets could not.But after Colon, 44, struggled mightily, the Braves parted ways with him last week, and he cleared waivers on Thursday.AdvertisementThe Mets considered bringing back Colon, as their pitching depth has suffered with regression or injuries to Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Robert Gsellman. But all three are expected back this summer.In an unusual move, General Manager Sandy Alderson issued a statement on Colon’s signing. “We made a strong effort to re-sign Bartolo,” the statement said. “But he decided to go elsewhere.”AdvertisementNow Colon will join Minnesota, which is in the American League playoff race, as the Mets are lagging heavily in the National League. Colon was to report to Class AAA Rochester, and then presumably join the Twins’ rotation.A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2017, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins Deal Sends Colon To Minors.
