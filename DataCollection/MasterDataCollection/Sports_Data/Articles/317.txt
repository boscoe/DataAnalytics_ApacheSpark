PHOENIX — Dillon Lee was perhaps the most valuable defensive player of the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31, amassing six tackles, one for a loss, and an interception in Alabama’s 38-0 demolition of Michigan State.Yet when No. 2 Alabama (13-1) plays No. 1 Clemson (14-0) in Glendale, Ariz., on Monday night for the national championship, Lee will very likely be a much quieter presence. In fact, Lee, a senior linebacker who could well wear an N.F.L. uniform in the fall, may not even play a majority of the snaps.That is life on the world-beating defense of the Crimson Tide, who have given up 13.4 points per game, the lowest mark in the Football Bowl Subdivision, and, according to the analyst Phil Steele, held opponents to an unrivaled 157 yards per game below their averages.Alabama’s defense nearly bursts, like overripe fruit, with talent. Behind its front seven are an equal number of players who would be full-time starters on almost any other team.Advertisement“They roll guys in there, play a lot of guys, a bunch of subs, and they all play at a really, really high level,” Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney said last week. “That’s the biggest thing that jumps out at you. Most teams that you play don’t have the type of depth that Alabama can present.”AdvertisementAlabama’s trick has been to turn that depth into intensely specialized platoons, determined by down, distance and, above all, offensive personnel and then to substitute aggressively so that the Tide almost always have the optimal defense to counter any particular offensive look.So what is Alabama’s defense?Well, whatever it wants to be.“We don’t just stay in one personnel and try to play every offense that way,” Lee said.Kirby Smart, the defensive coordinator for most of Coach Nick Saban’s tenure at Alabama, said that if an opponent put a lot of receivers on the field, Alabama would load up with defensive backs. “The less receivers they have on the field, the more the big, physical package we play,” Smart said.Lee, at 6 feet 4 inches and 242 pounds, is big enough to take on a blocking tight end yet fast enough to cover that tight end on a passing route. He generally played a more significant role this season against teams with traditional pro-style offenses built around the run and capable pocket passers; his role was more muted against teams with spread attacks and mobile quarterbacks.“When we’re going to play big-boy ball, he’s going to be in the game,” said Tosh Lupoi, the outside linebackers coach.Lee was a great fit against Michigan State’s ground-and-pound offense, but against Clemson and its starting quarterback, Deshaun Watson, who earned a trip to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony by extending plays with his feet, Lee will very likely be called upon less.To some extent, every defense transforms itself depending on the offense it is facing. Even most good high school programs have a nickel back — a third cornerback to sub in when an opposing offense trots out a pass-friendly formation. But no other college defense can match the depth of Alabama.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The adjustment is a response to the spread offenses that have proliferated in recent years and to mobile quarterbacks like Auburn’s Cam Newton, Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel and Ohio State’s Cardale Jones, who have most confounded Alabama.Advertisement“As football has changed, Nick and Kirby have finally given in to the modern offenses and just decided they’re not going to give up their situational defense and they’re going to aggressively substitute no matter what the offense does,” said Gary Danielson, a CBS Sports college football analyst who has broadcast many Southeastern Conference games.Bo Davis, Alabama’s defensive line coach, confirmed that analysis.“The way the spread offense is now — it’s fast-tempo; the ball is going fast — you have to roll a group of guys,” he said.The best counter an offense can make is to go no-huddle, making no substitutions and racing to the line of scrimmage after plays in order to prevent Alabama from making its swaps. Clemson, which averages the 13th-most plays per game, according to TeamRankings.com, is expected to take that approach on Monday.Even so, Alabama has elevated substitutions to an art form. Danielson noted that before one red-zone play against Louisiana State in November, there were 19 Alabama players standing around the end zone. Alabama’s coaches were not hoping that the referees would not notice; rather, they put many possible combinations of players on the field so that when L.S.U. sent out its personnel, the unneeded defenders could sprint off and leave the desired look behind.If Alabama’s system is so advantageous, why don’t more teams do it? Because only Alabama, with its championship résumé and its highly regarded coaches, has been able to routinely amass top-ranked recruiting classes, even while prospects know full well that they might play less at Alabama than they would elsewhere.

In the 2015 biography “Saban: The Making of a Coach,” by Monte Burke, Saban is modest about his coaching ability but allows that he is a superior recruiter. Mario Cristobal, Alabama’s offensive line coach, is the reigning recruiter of the year at Rivals.com, as Lupoi was for the 2010 class (while he was coaching at California).“You come in being all five-star, four-star, got the big head,” said Eddie Jackson, a junior who converted from cornerback to safety after Saban asked him to. “Then you come in, and you’re sitting on the bench waiting for your chance. It really humbles you.”AdvertisementIn high school, Lee was given an elite four-star designation and ranked the ninth-best outside linebacker nationally in the class of 2012. He was expected to stay in state and attend Georgia, where his brother Dallas played.Lee knew there were talented linebackers ahead of him at Alabama, like C. J. Mosley, who became a first-round N.F.L. draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens, and Trey DePriest. But Lee cared passionately about winning championships. His high school team went to the state final in all four of his years, winning it three times. He committed early to Alabama.“I recruited him hard,” said Smart, who was hired as Georgia’s head coach last month. “He saw it as a chance to be different — he wanted to be different.”Chad Simmons, a national recruiting analyst for Scout.com, said: “Bama goes and sells not only playing for Bama but being coached up and competition. In the last four or five years, a lot of people have recognized that you want to play with other talented players, you want to stay fresh, and it only takes one or two plays to put you on an N.F.L. draft board.”And there is one thing that makes Alabama’s case more distinctively than anything else.“When all is said and done,” Simmons said, “they win championships consistently.”A version of this article appears in print on January 11, 2016, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Wave After Wave of Defenders Help Tide Roll On.
