Maryland center Malina Howard had just completed her college career in a most unexpected fashion, a shocking loss to visiting Washington. The emotion of the moment was too much to bear.“It just hurts a lot,” she said, as she fought back tears. “It’s not how we wanted it to end.”Kelsey Plum scored 32 points as the seventh-seeded Huskies beat No. 2 Maryland, 74-65, Monday night in College Park, Md., to reach the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time in 15 years.Maryland (31-4), the two-time Big Ten champions, came in with a rich history of success in the postseason and a 10-game winning streak. The Terrapins were also playing on their home floor.AdvertisementNone of that mattered to the Huskies (24-10), who limited the Terrapins to 37 percent shooting and forced 15 turnovers.“I don’t think we ever got into the flow of the game — ever,” Howard said.The lackluster performance came against a Washington team that finished fifth in the Pacific-12 and barely got by Penn in the opening round for its first N.C.A.A. tournament victory since 2006.“Everything that we’ve done prepared us for this,” Washington Coach Mike Neighbors said. “We’ve been playing really good basketball the last month.”The Huskies will next play third-seeded Kentucky on Friday in Lexington, Ky.“I thought we maybe played not to lose, instead of playing to win,” Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. “Tough lesson to have to learn.”UCONN 97, DUQUESNE 51  Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck and Moriah Jefferson each scored 20 points in their final game together at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn., to lead Connecticut to a victory over Duquesne in a second-round game.AdvertisementStewart also grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked five shots.

But the Irish (33-1) quickly regained control with a layup by Arike Ogunbowale and a basket by Allen when she stole the inbounds pass by Leikem.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
