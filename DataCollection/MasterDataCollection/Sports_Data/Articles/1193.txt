As the worlds of fashion and tennis continue their racket-splitting collision — the favorites Roger Federer and Venus Williams alone have topped best-dressed lists and designed fashion lines — Wimbledon’s staunch “almost entirely in white” courtside dress code nevertheless persists.In fact, in 2013 it was Federer’s electric orange-soled Nikes that may have prompted the All England Club to update its official guide to include accessories and undergarments in its list of forbidden canvases for color.With the 10-deep tablet of commandments firmly intact, here is a sepia-toned tour (which, akin to the prohibited “off white or cream,” would also be a no-no) of the most creative ways past players have bucked convention.The lace-edged silk jersey panties peeking beneath a short skirt made Moran, 25, a news media darling — so much so that The New York Times devoted much of its 2013 obituary of the California native to the outfit.He tempted the All England Club’s ire with patriotic stripes of color on his sleeves, socks and headband, all the better to set off his signature mane.The mastermind behind White’s spandex catsuit was the designer Ted Tinling, who became somewhat of an enfant terrible when his color-trimmed dress for Betty Hilton in 1948 caused the Wimbledon committee to hang signs in dressing rooms reading, “Competitors are required to wear all-white clothing.”The most transgressive choice that Agassi, 21, could have made for his appearance at Wimbledon was to abide by the rules and stick with white — a stipulation he had previously found so unpalatable that he had not played in prior championships. His highlighted mullet managed to lend a characteristic edge.Golovin was 19 in 2007, seven years before the All England Club’s explicit decree that undergarments abide by the all-white rule, a sartorial coup for the French player, whose red shorts provided a rare flash of color on the court.The news media cast Sharapova’s tuxedo-style top and tailored shorts, an original design by Nike, as the scapegoat for her loss to the under-the-radar player Alla Kudryavtseva. For her part, Kudryavtseva did not refute the claim. “I was pleased to beat her: I didn’t like her outfit,” The Telegraph reported her as saying.Like her sister, Williams moves comfortably in fashion’s orbit, helming a line for HSN since 2009 and gracing the covers of Vogue and Vanity Fair. Her attempts to break out of the Wimbledon box included a sharp white trench coat in 2008 — worn during warm-ups — and punchy, Pop Art inspired nail art in 2013.Color may be taboo on the court, but whimsy has not yet been censored by Wimbledon officials. Mattek-Sands, the No. 1-ranked women’s doubles player, took this into account when wearing a jacket festooned with tennis balls and fringe designed by Alex Noble, a Lady Gaga collaborator, in 2011. Likewise, Mattek-Sands’s tennis-ball-hued hair in 2013 did not break any rules, but it did provide a welcome dose of daring.Federer, currently favored to win his eighth title at Wimbledon, nevertheless has a tortured sartorial history with the club’s fashion rules. In 2014, a year after his Day-Glo-bright soles caused the committee to restrict accessories to “almost entirely white,” he lamented: “White, white, full-on white. I think it’s very strict. My personal opinion: I think it’s too strict.”On a court governed by the backlash from Federer’s Nikes, Kuznetsova’s highly visible tattoos were still able to provide a splash of spirited style. “Pain doesn’t kill me, I kill the pain,” Kuznetsova’s biceps-spanning tattoo reads, a message more potent than any colorful affront.Advertisement
