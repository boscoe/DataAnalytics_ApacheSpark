Simone Biles brought down the house at the Rio Games on Tuesday as she and her American teammates handily won the gold medal in the women’s gymnastics team final. Biles, who is considered the best in the world in her sport, is likely to collect a second gold Thursday in the all-around final, the crown jewel of Olympic gymnastics.Follow our live blog of the women’s all-around gymnastics competition here.Scores for the top ten competitors are listed below.The competition starts at 3 p.m. Eastern, but NBC has scheduled its coverage for prime time.

                Mary Lou Retton has described her as the top gymnast in history.            Biles earned her all-around spot with the top score in qualification: 62.366. Her teammate Aly Raisman finished second but was nearly 2 points behind Biles in an event often decided by tenths of a point. Look for both women to deliver commanding routines: Biles usually aces every flip and leap; Raisman is particularly strong on vault and floor exercise.AdvertisementThe reigning all-around champion, Gabby Douglas, will not defend her title because of the two-per-country rule: Only two athletes from a nation can advance to a medal round, limiting the United States and other gymnastics powerhouses from sweeping a podium. This means that exceptional athletes, like Douglas, do not compete while some gymnasts with lower scores do. The American Jordyn Wieber, a 2011 world champion, was similarly left out during the 2012 London Games.Raisman has called the rule “the dumbest thing ever.” Others have agreed, saying the exclusion of top gymnasts tarnishes the competition. Vanessa Ferrari of Italy, for example, scored a 55.265 and finished 29th in qualification Sunday. She will compete Thursday over Douglas, who finished third and earned a 60.131.AdvertisementThe International Federation of Gymnastics has countered that putting less competitive athletes into medal rounds could help the sport grow in their countries.Biles is a virtual lock for the gold, and Raisman could win silver or bronze. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, whose vault helped her finish right behind Douglas in qualification, would probably need to improve her score from Sunday by about 2 points to have a shot at overtaking Raisman.Aliya Mustafina of Russia should be on Raisman’s heels. Mustafina tied Raisman, with 59.566 total points, in the all-around at the 2012 London Games. To break the tie, the lowest score for each gymnast was dropped, and the remaining three were summed. That gave Mustafina the bronze.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Like Raisman, she is best on what are known as the power events: vault and floor.■ Giulia Steingruber: The reigning European all-around champion, from Switzerland, also qualified for the vault and floor finals.Advertisement■ Seda Tutkhalyan: She qualified ahead of Mustafina, her Russian teammate. So far, her best score in Rio is on uneven bars.■ Shang Chunsong: Shang, of China, had reportedly been ill before the competition and had a shaky vault Sunday. Still, she made the cut for the all-around and the bars final.■ Wang Yan: Shang’s teammate could also make the podium. China is generally known for its work on bars and beam.(Larisa Iordache, the all-around bronze medalist at last year’s world championships, is absent because Romania gave its one slot in the Games to the Olympic veteran Catalina Ponor. Ponor sat out bars and vault this week, which made her ineligible for the all-around.)We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
