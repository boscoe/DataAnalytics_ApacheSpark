An Olympic track and field competition without Russia appears to be an ever-stronger possibility after the sport’s governing body said that Russia had significant work to do to have its ban for doping lifted in time for the Rio Games, which begin in August.Rune Andersen, a Norwegian who heads a five-member international task force reviewing Russia’s reforms after its suspension from global competition, said the Russian track and field federation had made progress. “However, the view of the task force is that there is significant work still to be done to satisfy the reinstatement conditions,” Anderson said at a news conference in Monaco after a meeting of the International Association of Athletics Federations.The comments incensed Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister, who insisted that his country had done enough to meet the association’s antidoping standards.■ The World Anti-Doping Agency said that it had recorded 99 positive tests for meldonium, the recently banned drug at the center of the case involving Maria Sharapova, who hit back at suggestions that she had received five separate warnings about changes to tennis’s antidoping rules. Sharapova wrote on her Facebook page that she had received one clear notice in December titled “Main Changes to the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme for 2016.” Sharapova wrote: “I should have paid more attention to it. But the other ‘communications’? They were buried in newsletters, websites or handouts.” (REUTERS)A version of this brief appears in print on March 12, 2016, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Setback for Russian Track.
