Standing by his locker after the Rangers’ 3-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens in Game 3 of their playoff series on Sunday, Mats Zuccarello modeled a fresh set of stitches and a streak of blood on his chin.“Maybe a high stick,” he thought.He did not know the exact number of stitches and he could not recall the incident. Frankly, those things did not matter a bit to him. What bothered Zuccarello, and what had him apologizing profusely, was his own loose high stick that drew blood from Andrei Markov in the second period.That sloppy mistake in the offensive zone cost Zuccarello a pair of two-minute minor penalties, leading to Montreal’s pivotal second goal and eventually a two-games-to-one lead for the Canadiens.“That’s on me,” Zuccarello said of his own high stick. “Obviously, I don’t try to hit him in the face. But obviously, I put the team in a bad spot.”AdvertisementIf any single player represents the esprit and soul of this Rangers team, it is Zuccarello. The team’s little sparkplug and leading scorer this season can fly, pass and finish. But like many of his high-profile teammates, he is finding himself frustrated and bottled up by Montreal’s structured, pinching defense.AdvertisementThe Rangers will need to break out of their typical home-ice malaise on Tuesday in Game 4 if they are to stay in this best-of-seven series. They can ill afford a seventh straight home playoff loss over three baffling springtimes.“We all have to play better,” said Zuccarello, who managed one shot on goal in Game 3, in which the Rangers produced only 12 shots on goal as a team in the first two periods. “We shouldn’t be tight at home. Everyone has to dig deep. We need to get forechecking and get to the net.”There is a long-held theorem in hockey, a formula more instinctive than mathematical, that applies to the N.H.L. playoffs: If two teams are paired in a relatively even matchup, then the more desperate club will probably win the next game. That should make the Rangers favorites for Game 4 at Madison Square Garden because they would be unlikely to recover from a three-games-to-one deficit heading back to the Bell Centre for a Game 5.But they have yet to show that sort of bite and, as Zuccarello put it: “We need to be desperate for every game. Not just the next one.”There is the gnawing thought that these two clubs are not so even, that the Canadiens have demonstrated more fire, more discipline under pressure and by far the more effective special teams in man-advantage situations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Then, in Game 3, the Rangers went 0 for 3 on power plays — they are now 0 for 10 in the series — while Montreal scored on two of three such opportunities.“We’re definitely fighting it a little bit, to say the least,” Ryan McDonagh said of the team’s impotent power play. “If it’s not going well, we really need to simplify here, make one or two passes and look to get it to the net. We are maybe looking to extend our plays a little bit too much and it’s costing us scoring opportunities.”Alain Vigneault, the Rangers’ coach, complimented the Canadiens on their structure and resolve, while aiming considerable criticism at Zuccarello and J. T. Miller, both guilty of critical infractions.Advertisement“Two offensive penalties, 200 feet from our net,” Vigneault said. “At this time, our best line is our fourth line. Our top players have to find their game, and they obviously don’t have it right now. We need to find an answer to use our skill a little bit more.”The Rangers have scored just six goals in the first three games. Chris Kreider, the team leader with 28 goals in the regular season, has not scored or managed an assist. Kevin Hayes, who struggled late in the season, is also without a goal or an assist.The Canadiens, meanwhile, congratulated themselves on a nearly perfect road game. They neutralized the Garden crowd, an easily discouraged bunch. There was no sense of energy inside the place after that second goal by Shea Weber 7 minutes 42 seconds into the third period.The Rangers and their fans now have precious little margin for such indifference. But this series already spun once on a dime, and may do so again. If the Rangers had held on for just 18 more seconds during regulation in Game 2, it might have been enough to demoralize the Canadiens and set this series on an irreversible course.That did not happen. Twist the cliché in whatever direction and it’s still true for the Rangers in Game 4: Die, or do. Never, or now.A version of this article appears in print on April 18, 2017, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: After Costly Mistake, Zuccarello Urges Rangers to Play With Desperation.
