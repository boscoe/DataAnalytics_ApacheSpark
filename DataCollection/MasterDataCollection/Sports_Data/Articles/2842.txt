Paul Hornung, the Hall of Fame running back with the Green Bay Packers, has sued Riddell, asserting that the company knew of the dangers of brain trauma more than 50 years ago but failed to warn him and other players that their helmets would do nothing to prevent concussions.The lawsuit, which seeks damages of at least $50,000, is the latest legal challenge against Riddell, the biggest sports helmet manufacturer in the country. Riddell is a co-defendant with the N.F.L. in a class-action lawsuit filed by thousands of former football players who accused the company and the league of hiding the dangers of concussions from them.In that case, Riddell was able to separate its claims from the N.F.L., which has agreed to a settlement that could pay hundreds of millions of dollars to players with severe neurological disorders. Once that case is fully resolved — it still may be appealed — the federal judge overseeing it, Anita B. Brody, will return to the question of whether the players have a legitimate claim against Riddell.
                In his complaint filed in state court in Illinois, Hornung claims that Riddell should have warned players that its plastic helmets, while helping prevent skull fractures, “provided no protection” against brain trauma, including concussions.            Hornung, though, sued only Riddell, so that his case would not be lumped together with the class-action suit, which is being heard in Philadelphia.AdvertisementIn his complaint, filed in state court in Illinois, Hornung claims that Riddell should have warned players that its plastic helmets, while helping to prevent skull fractures, “provided no protection” against brain trauma, including concussions.Advertisement“Prior to, during and after Paul Hornung’s N.F.L. football career, Riddell knew of the harmful long-term effects of brain traumas sustained by football players while wearing Riddell’s supposed protective equipment; however, it misrepresented and concealed these facts from Paul Hornung,” the complaint said.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In college, at Notre Dame, he wore a leather helmet without a face mask. It was only when he made it to the N.F.L. that he wore a plastic helmet with a face mask.Hornung’s lawyers said that players were led to believe the plastic helmet would offer more protection, which emboldened them to take risks they never would have taken with leather helmets.“Riddell made promises to everyone that wore that helmet, and the evidence will show that they built an industry based on the safety of the device, analogous to filters on cigarettes,” said Brad Sohn, one of the lawyers representing Hornung. “People relied on them to make the game safer, when in fact it made it more dangerous.”A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2016, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Hall of Famer Hornung Sues Helmet Maker.
