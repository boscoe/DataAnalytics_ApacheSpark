The Rams of Tec de Monterrey are a college football power. Ask Cam Newton.By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLDNOV. 17, 2016
MONTERREY, Mexico — Like many football-crazed boys, Luis Carranza grew up with a poster of Emmitt Smith, his hero, on his bedroom wall and vowed to emulate him.He took a one-hour bus ride to football practice, starting at age 4, and the discipline of study, running, study, running earned him a spot first on an elite high school team and then on what may as well be Mexico’s Crimson Tide: the Rams of Tec de Monterrey.He is now a star running back, and pint-size fans cried out his name and engulfed him for autographs after a recent victory, even though an injury had knocked him out of the game early. A star is a star.“It’s such a big tradition here,” Carranza said. “Everybody is committed, even the little fans.”There is no tailgating here, but the stadium tacos aren’t bad. Nobody cries “Gooooool!” at a big score, but the “touch” in “Touchdown!” gets more gusto. Instead of billion-dollar television deals, the games are limited to local TV and streamed on an internet site. And whatever signing bonus these players have in their future will probably come not from the N.F.L. but from the law firms and businesses many are headed to after graduation.AdvertisementThe addiction to the other fútbol — “fútbol soccer,” as people make the distinction here — is better known in this country. But the fever for American football — “fútbol americano” — feeds a vibrant subculture rooted in college teams that attract thousands of fans and players for the Tigres (Tigers), the Potros (Colts), the Aztecas (Aztecs), the Pumas, the Águilas (Eagles) and one of the oldest and most winning teams, the Borregos Salvajes (Rams.)Advertisement“The big difference with the Americans is size and speed, in which they have an advantage over us,” Carranza, 23, said, explaining the appeal. “But here we play with heart.”On Monday, the N.F.L., picking up on the American football passion here, will play its first regular-season game in Mexico in 11 years, the Houston Texans versus the Oakland Raiders at the famed Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.The game, the first Monday Night Football contest to be played outside the United States, is sold out, with 76,000 expected to attend.
CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times        American football does not have the global reach of basketball and baseball, but it is played in dozens of countries. In an international tournament of college teams, Mexico has won back-to-back championships, this year defeating a team from the United States made up of Division III players. Mexico has also done well in postcollegiate international tournaments.This surprises nobody in Monterrey, where the Borregos Salvajes have long exemplified the best football in the country.It was only a scrimmage, but the team’s 2009 defeat of Blinn College in Texas, which featured Cam Newton at quarterback, is still recalled here with the fervor of the Catch and other great N.F.L. plays.“We didn’t know anything about the team, but we heard all this talk about this great Division I quarterback playing for them,” said Sergio Cantu Muñoz, a Tec coach and former player who intercepted Newton, then playing for Blinn between stops at the University of Florida and Auburn.AdvertisementPulling up the video of the play he keeps on his cellphone, he added, “I didn’t realize until later how important it was.”Tec de Monterrey has had an American football team for nearly 70 years, an outgrowth of the sport carried to Mexico by American visitors years before then.A handful of its players over the years have landed on practice squads in the N.F.L., but Mexico has had only fledgling professional leagues, including one that started in February but has only four teams.Most players here know that college is the pinnacle of the sport. And then they graduate and move on to careers.The league gives players seven years of eligibility as long as they remain enrolled in classes, meaning some are earning master’s degrees.Carranza is studying to be a lawyer, as are several of his teammates, while other players are working toward jobs in finance, engineering and other professions. The team claims a 90 percent graduation rate.It makes Tec de Monterrey, one of the highest-ranking universities academically in Latin America, something more of a Stanford, then. But with more championships than any other college, it can brag of the winning tradition of an Alabama.“I would say they are like a midway Division II team or a strong Division III,” said Frank Gonzalez, a former longtime coach who unsuccessfully sought to have the university join the N.C.A.A. “There have been many players good enough to play in the N.F.L., but there are many more players good enough in the United States. There is no pipeline here to send them to the league.”The players say they are in it more for the game than for the fame.Unlike soccer, with a powerful professional league and a system of clubs and academies to recruit and mold young players, American football has a pipeline that is more ad hoc.AdvertisementMany have followed a similar progression, the sons of players who joined one of the hundreds of youth football clubs in the country and then landed on high school and college teams, most often with the help of scholarships.Tec de Monterrey has had a football team for nearly 70 years, an outgrowth of the sport carried to Mexico by American visitors years before.Television, and more recently the internet, have helped stoke interest in the game; N.F.L. and college games have regularly aired for years, and cable and satellite television has expanded the offerings.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some of the Rams coach the younger players.Concerns about concussions and their serious consequences into adulthood have been raised by parents here, though the issue has not been as extensively covered as in the United States.Hugo Barberi, the coach of one of the largest teams here, said that membership dropped off about 15 percent after the 2015 movie “Concussion,” about a forensic pathologist’s fight against the N.F.L. to recognize brain disease in players linked to their years of playing, but that it had rebounded in recent months.The club reduced contact at practices and changed tackling techniques to de-emphasize head-to-head collisions.AdvertisementLikewise, at the college level, neurological testing has been introduced before and during the season, and coaches said efforts had been made to curtail dangerous hits.The thinking here is that while the level of awareness of the health consequences might not be the same as in the United States, neither is the intensity of the game.“The game is not as physical here,” said Alberto García Castillo, the owner and editor of Receptor.com.mx, an online publication in Mexico that covers American football. “There are hits, but it is done without losing valor and respect for the other side.”Still, teams want to win, and the dominance of Tec and its sister campuses, fed in part by robust scholarship offers, resulted in the college league’s being divided several years ago.Tec campuses — they all wear blue-and-white uniforms and have the same Borregos nickname — joined with a handful of other private universities, while the public universities have their own league.They are fierce rivals and, García Castillo said, have accused one another of unfair recruiting practices.This year, there were some interleague games — some of them drawing thousands of fans — and the champions of the two conferences will meet in a “super bowl” for the first time since the split.For the Rams in Monterrey, the pressure is on to win it.They entered the playoffs Saturday with a 6-4 record, while they have previously been undefeated or had only one or two losses. They won their playoff game, though, and advanced to the final next Saturday.AdvertisementNevertheless, it has been a trying season. Carlos Altamirano is the third coach this season, after one was fired for manhandling a player in practice, and an interim coach did not get the top job.The fever for American football — “fútbol americano” — feeds a vibrant subculture rooted in Mexico's college teams.“Eso! Eso!” That’s it! he barked, pushing the quarterbacks through a set of scrambling drills as “Highway to Hell” and other rock and hip-hop hits blared from speakers.Instruction — and cursing — in Spanish mixed with the usual English football terms: touchdown, quarterback, lineman. Plays are written and called in English, as well, partly because many are adapted from the team’s American counterparts and several of the coaches have attended training clinics in the United States. For a time, coaches wanted the players to “play in English” so they would be familiar with the terms if they earned a tryout with an American team.That largely remains a dream.Carlos Martell, 23, a linebacker who is Carranza’s classmate in legal studies, grew up surrounded by football memorabilia, and his father invites friends and family members over every Sunday to watch N.F.L. games. Martell has been playing the game since he was 4, but he knows he is not big or fast enough to play at the N.F.L. level.“Here, the main thing is school, your studies,” he said. “We may have dreams about playing in the N.F.L., but we also know so few have made it.”Before the last regular-season game, the Rams players gathered for a vulgarity-laced pep rally among themselves in the stands of the football stadium, which was set to host its final game. After 66 years, it will be demolished and a new football stadium built. The players hung a banner reading “Always Home” and signed it.“Leave everything on the field,” said one. “What happens tomorrow, keep it in your heart, man,” urged another. “Let’s rip this mother up, boys!” said another.And so they did, demolishing their opponent, the Rams of Tec’s Mexico City campus, 28-0. In the fourth quarter, when the stadium loudspeaker played “Jump Around,” that is what the Monterrey players did on the sideline.AdvertisementOnly a few hundred people attended the game; Tec usually wins, after all, and many players and coaches believe the leagues should reunite so that the best teams across the country face each other more regularly.“The level of competition needs to improve,” said Eduardo Marcos Califa, 23, who scored one of the touchdowns. “If that happens, the interest will grow more.”Carranza ended up on the sideline for much of the game, and not for the first time. He had torn a ligament in his knee a couple of years ago but managed to bounce back.“The ups and downs, this is what American football teaches you,” he said. “Don’t give up; overcome challenges. Our classes give you constant challenges, and you have to find solutions. You have to try something different. That’s the same on the field. That’s been my life on the field.”A version of this article appears in print on November 20, 2016, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexico’s Crimson Tide.
