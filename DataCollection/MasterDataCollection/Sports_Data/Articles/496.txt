It just might not be right away.“Look, what he’s facing is fixable,” Myers said. “It’s just finding the issue and solving it. So I think that’s how you have to differentiate what he’s going through with somebody else.”Kerr, 51, plans to be examined at Stanford this week. He did not coach the Warriors in Games 3 and 4 at Portland last week while dealing with symptoms that make him extremely uncomfortable.ROCKETS OWNER FINED The owner of the Houston Rockets, Leslie Alexander, was fined $100,000 by the N.B.A. for confronting a referee during live game action.The episode occurred Tuesday in the final minute of the first quarter during the Rockets’ 105-99 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.
