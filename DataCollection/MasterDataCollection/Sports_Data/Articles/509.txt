BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox, who have been aggressively chasing a return to the World Series since Dave Dombrowski became president of baseball operations less than two years ago, made their latest bold, big-money move on Friday.But this was not an addition, as when Dombrowski landed David Price and Chris Sale the past two winters.Rather, this was subtraction — the Red Sox designating third baseman Pablo Sandoval for assignment.The move means that the Red Sox, unless they are able to work out a trade for Sandoval in the next seven days, will eat the nearly $48 million that remains on his five-year, $95 million free-agent contract that he signed in the off-season after catching the final out of the 2014 World Series for the San Francisco Giants.Advertisement“It really came down to us feeling we were not a better club if he was on our club at the major league level,” Dombrowski said at a news conference.AdvertisementUnlike the N.F.L., where player contracts are not guaranteed, or the N.B.A., which has the so-called stretch provision, which provides salary cap relief for teams that let go of players with burdensome deals, there is no financial incentive in baseball for teams to buy out bad contracts.Increasingly, though, teams are swallowing hard.Two years ago, the Los Angeles Dodgers bought out the $35 million remaining on outfielder Carl Crawford’s contract, and the Yankees released Alex Rodriguez, who was owed $27 million. Last season, the Colorado Rockies bought out the $38 million remaining on Jose Reyes’s contract — though their decision was affected by Reyes’s involvement in a domestic-violence case.“I would never want anybody to think that financial decisions along those lines are easy decisions to make, or easy conversations to have,” Dombrowski said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He was hitting just .212 at the time, but even more disappointing was his defense, Dombrowski said.In his place, the Red Sox have turned to the reserve Deven Marrero and Tzu-Wei Lin, called up from Class AA, who have played superior defense and have hit well of late. The utility player Brock Holt, who can also play third base, is close to being reactivated from the disabled list.It has been a dizzying fall for Sandoval, whose squat physique earned him the nickname Kung Fu Panda in San Francisco, where he helped the Giants win three World Series titles and earned the Series’ Most Valuable Player Award in 2012.If fans in San Francisco found the 5-foot-11, 255-pound Sandoval endearing — he provided not only humorous moments but clutch ones, too, in the playoffs — his tenure in Boston went wrong from the start, when he showed up for his first spring training woefully out of shape.Sandoval hit for a then-career-low .658 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in 2015, when the Red Sox finished in last place in the American League East. And he missed virtually all of last season after shoulder surgery, when the Red Sox won the division title.First place is where the Red Sox are again at the moment, when they came to the decision that while they owed Sandoval $48 million, it was more costly to keep him around.An article in some editions last Saturday about a decision by the Boston Red Sox to designate third baseman Pablo Sandoval for assignment misstated the number of days the Red Sox had to trade him or else be responsible for the nearly $48 million remaining on his contract. It was seven days, not 10.A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2017, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Red Sox Pull the Plug on Sandoval, A Pricey Player With Paltry Results.
