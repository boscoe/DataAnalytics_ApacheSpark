Dak Prescott accounted for two touchdowns, his fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliott ran for two more, and the Dallas Cowboys extended their franchise regular-season record with a 10th straight victory, beating the Washington Redskins, 31-26, on Thursday.Prescott tied Don Meredith’s 50-year-old club record for quarterbacks with his fifth rushing touchdown, and the N.F.L.-leading Cowboys won despite 449 yards passing and three touchdowns from Kirk Cousins, the first Redskins quarterback to post two 400-yard games in a season.Dallas Coach Jason Garrett praised Prescott’s play.“Over and over and over again, at critical moments, he came up with a big play, whether it was a third down, down in the red zone, again and again and again he just played winning football for us,” Garrett said.The Redskins, the defending division champions, were swept by their N.F.C. East rival Dallas and fell three and a half games behind the Cowboys with five games left after their seventh Thanksgiving loss to them in eight tries.AdvertisementThe 21-year-old Elliott, the N.F.L.’s rushing leader, had 97 yards, giving him 1,199 for the season.AdvertisementThe Cowboys’ eight-game streak of at least 400 yards on offense ended, as they finished with 353. But Dallas answered with touchdowns when the Redskins pulled within a score on Cousins’s 5-yard pass to Jordan Reed and again on his 67-yard throw to DeSean Jackson, who had 118 yards receiving.After Cousins’s second scoring toss to Reed, an 8-yarder with 1 minute 53 seconds remaining, Dustin Hopkins’s onside kick went out of bounds and the Cowboys ran out the clock.Reed had 10 catches for 95 yards after missing most of the first half with an injury to his left shoulder, sustained when he leapt for a pass over his head in the end zone.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
