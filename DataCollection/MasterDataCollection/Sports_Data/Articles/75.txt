Gone are the days when the defender would not meet its challenger until the opening day of the America’s Cup match itself — a moment of pure suspense because not even the skippers truly knew how big the gap would be.Now, though spying and well-kept secrets still exist, there is fraternizing with the enemy on a regular basis as all the teams compete in the preliminary regattas in the years leading to the Cup. Having Oracle Team USA join the actual challenger series is the next step, one that not all the challengers embrace.“That’s a big shift,” said Ben Ainslie, the skipper and team principal of the British challenger Land Rover BAR. “It certainly raised a few eyebrows, and I think for this cycle, I didn’t necessarily like it that much, but when you look at where you’re going in the future, it’s what you had to create. Because you want to create racing where all the teams are involved. You want to create a circuit.”That is the goal of the majority for now. Russell Coutts, a New Zealander who has won the Cup five times and who is head of the America’s Cup Event Authority organizing this Cup, has long been a fan of Formula One.The idea is to make the America’s Cup a league more than a challenge cup, to make it as mainstream as possible while aligning its teams’ budgets with its revenues and no longer depending on the stray billionaire business model.The majority would like to see the Cup contested more frequently: every two years instead of the now-customary three or four. The biennial timetable was part of a framework agreement signed in January by Oracle and four of this year’s five challengers, one that further integrates the defender and challengers.The accord also committed to using this same new class of foiling catamarans, just under 50 feet in length, for the next two America’s Cups. Reaching such an agreement before determining the next defender is without precedent, and there are doubts about whether it could withstand a legal challenge.There is also one vocal holdout among the challengers: Emirates Team New Zealand, which blew what should have been an insurmountable 8-1 lead in San Francisco to lose the last America’s Cup match to Oracle in 2013.Bad blood still simmers along with mistrust, which guarantees that this America’s Cup will retain the traditional sharp edge.Grant Dalton, Team New Zealand’s chief executive, told me earlier this year that his team wants to preserve the traditional challenger-defender divide stipulated by the regatta’s founding document. He is convinced sailing “will never be mainstream” and that the Cup is not broken. He also said his team sees itself as a “lone wolf.”I asked Oracle’s Australian skipper, Jimmy Spithill, on Thursday if he sees the Kiwis that way, too. “I think Grant Dalton has shown he’s a lone wolf,” Spithill said, eyes flashing. “It’s rare for me to agree with him, but I think he’s correct.”Ainslie, who once worked for Dalton and Team New Zealand, has urged him to join the discussions but believes that Dalton’s cultivation of “a siege mentality” is a good motivational tool for his team. But he questions whether Dalton, whose team is commercially funded, will reach significantly different conclusions about the future if the Kiwis do win the Cup. “It’s hard to see a wildly different path to what we’re proposing,” Ainslie said.Spithill maintains that the cooperative tack is the best way forward, but the rub of course in Bermuda is that the cooperative approach is also a likely boost to Oracle’s chances of defending successfully.Racing in the qualifiers means Oracle will be able to test its boat against the opposition before it really needs to sail its fastest (though there is a bonus point available to Oracle for the America’s Cup match if it wins the qualifier round).The arrangement also means Oracle will have downtime to fine-tune its boat for the America’s Cup match while the challengers go through the semifinal and final rounds, which Oracle will sit out.“It is a big advantage,” Ainslie said of Oracle’s taking part in the qualifiers.Another big advantage for the defender is that, with the teams allowed to build only one AC Class catamaran, Oracle has been able to run what is essentially a two-boat program by sharing technology and information with its partner syndicate SoftBank Team Japan, which some in the Cup refer to snidely as “Oracle Team Japan.”Ainslie points out that Oracle’s advantages in this Cup were fairly negotiated with its initial challenger of record: an Australian team that eventually withdrew.“You have to take your hat off to them,” Ainslie said of Oracle. “That was actually pretty smart negotiating”Spithill points out that Team New Zealand had a similar arrangement with the Italian Team Luna Rossa during the last Cup, although those two teams were both challengers.“They were sharing,” Spithill said. “I don’t think they did that good a job of it because they weren’t completely open and the Italians ended up with a slower boat, but in our situation Japan has got exactly the same boat.”At least for now it does. Much can change in a hurry in the boat sheds and in the water during the Cup, just as it did in San Francisco in 2013.Much has changed since then, too, including the fact that Oracle and its American owner Larry Ellison are defending the oldest major trophy in sports outside of the United States rather than at home.More surprises undoubtedly are ahead. For now, and for just one more day, Bermuda’s blue waters and its brand-new America’s Cup village — built on a man-made island — await.Advertisement
