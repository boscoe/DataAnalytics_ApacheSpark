During a trip to Junior’s restaurant in early February, Nana Fujimoto sat against a wall decorated with Brooklyn Dodgers memorabilia, savoring a slice of cheesecake while discussing her journey from Sapporo, Japan, to the National Women’s Hockey League.Like Duke Snider and Jackie Robinson featured in the photos above her, Fujimoto, whose 5-foot-4 frame minds the net for the New York Riveters, has won over local fans. Her No. 33 jersey is abundantly spotted at rinks throughout the league, where Japanese television crews often follow her.For Fujimoto, the popularity is an afterthought. She came to the United States only to prove herself against the world’s top hockey players. In January, she was named a starter in the N.W.H.L.’s first All-Star Game.Despite her rising status, Fujimoto, 27, is uncertain if she can return next season.A frequent story line during the N.W.H.L.’s first year has been the sacrifices made by its 72 players to expand the game of women’s hockey. These costs are magnified for the 21 international players hailing from Austria, Canada, Japan and Russia, some who moved to the United States for personal and professional reasons that extend beyond passion for the sport.AdvertisementTheir success has helped fuel the league’s increased global popularity and the growth of local fan bases, but many international players remain unsure how long their careers here are sustainable.Advertisement“If possible, I want to play here as long as possible,” Fujimoto said through her interpreter, Nori Matsuura.The biggest obstacle impeding their future plans stems from the P-1 visa for athletes, which restricts international players’ ability to work outside of competing in the N.W.H.L., where the maximum salary is $25,000.The financial constraints are less burdensome for Fujimoto, who is still employed by Denso Hokkaido, a company that manufactures automotive semiconductor sensors. But her competitive aspirations are largely tied to the Japanese national team, which has carried the nickname Smile Japan in recent years.Japan has been the underdog darling of women’s hockey, because of an unexpected trip to the 2014 Winter Olympics and a spirited showing at the 2015 world championships, where Fujimoto won the award for best goaltender.After the world championships, Fujimoto tried out for the N.W.H.L. in part to shed the cute, almost patronizing labels associated with Japanese women’s hockey. Despite individual honors, she was not proud of her team’s performance on the international stage. Her objective was to improve by playing against the world’s best on a weekly basis, and to win a medal at the 2018 Olympics.“I don’t care about how people are thinking about Team Japan, how people see Team Japan is like, but of course I want to break the role and want to win,” Fujimoto said.Four other Japanese players — Aina Takeuchi, Kanae Aoki, Sena Suzuki and Tomomi Kurata — are competing in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League with similar ambitions. According to a league representative, the players have visitor visas and are part of efforts by Japan’s hockey governing bodies to develop their skills.AdvertisementFor decades, the United States and Canada have dominated women’s hockey at international competitions.The desire to rise to their level has also driven Janine Weber of Austria, who formerly played in the C.W.H.L., and scored the winning goal in last year’s league final, before becoming the first player to sign with the N.W.H.L.Before the season, Weber said she favored the increase in practice and individual training times made available by the Riveters, which would offset her inability to work another job.Commissioner Dani Rylan said the N.W.H.L. would continually focus on expanding its international footprint and improving living conditions for foreign players. The N.W.H.L.’s streaming packages are available abroad — 17 countries in five continents combine for almost 50 percent of total viewership.Rylan is contacted weekly by prospective players from areas not represented in the league, such as Scandinavia or Hungary. After many international players missed the start of the season because of delays in obtaining visas, the league moved up its free agency opening date to May 1, to prevent similar mishaps next season.“At the end of the day, we’ll have the best players around the world,” Rylan said.While the league comprises mostly athletes in their early or mid-20s, when struggling to earn money after college is not uncommon, Connecticut Whale forward Katia Smolentseva, 34, has other challenges. She moved to the United States from Russia to refine her game against better competition, but was accompanied by a young daughter, while the remainder of her family stayed home.Lyudmila Belyakova, 21, a forward for the Riveters, said one of the biggest difficulties for her was the distance from her family in Russia. In 2007, Belyakova played at the Bell Capital Cup, a prestigious youth tournament in Canada. Enthralled by the attitude toward hockey here, Belyakova said the “purpose of my life” became playing in North America.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In Russia, outside of family, few spectators attended women’s hockey games. Belyakova said at one point last season her club stopped paying player salaries, two teams folded and news media coverage was almost nonexistent.Learning English has been another challenge for the league’s Russian players. Fujimoto’s command of the language has improved since arriving in October, but she also had to adapt to an American style of play. The Riveters prioritized offense, while in Japan, where rinks are bigger, defense is emphasized.Advertisement“I’ve been thinking of this difficulty of playing comfortably with this system — this is not because my teammates are not skilled or the team is not strong,” Fujimoto said. “This is just a system that is not best for me.”After the N.W.H.L. playoffs, which began Friday, Fujimoto will return to Japan to train with the national team. Like many international players, she has yet to discuss a contract for next season. Playing in a Japanese men’s league remains a possibility, but Fujimoto is unsure if that level of competition will be more beneficial than the N.W.H.L.With the 2017 Asian Winter Games and 2018 Olympics in South Korea on the horizon, Fujimoto said her obligations to the national team could influence her to stay closer to Japan.For the league’s Canadian players, many of whom played in high school and college in the United States, there is less culture shock, but they struggle to make ends meet.Connecticut Whale goalie Jaimie Leonoff, who played at Yale, would like to become an American citizen and said she believed that showing steady employment through the N.W.H.L. would help her application process.

Players work for the clubs, who pay the league a fee. The league then pays the players some of that money for their services.Sydney Kidd of the Riveters uses her spare time to run errands with league staff, comparing it to working for a start-up where singular roles are less defined.AdvertisementKidd said joining the league had been a rewarding experience. She finds joy in minute aspects of living in a new country, walking across the Brooklyn Bridge or waiting in line for cookies at Levain Bakery, but her $15,000 salary has its limits.“I make it work right now, but on a long-term basis it’s probably not realistic,” Kidd, 23, said. “Bagels are cheap, so that’s good. Bagels and pizza.”Before Kidd signed with the Riveters, her father placed an emphasis on finishing her master’s degree. She did not arrive in the United States until November. Waiting for her visa, she worried if she had made the right choice.Four months later, she said her decision had largely been justified.She recalled how after the Riveters’ final home game on Feb. 14, the team signed autographs for close to three hours.“I was like, ‘This is what it’s like to be famous,’ ” said Kidd, who grew up in Sundridge, Ontario, which she described as “a town of 1,000 people where we didn’t even have a McDonald’s.”Assessing her future, she added, “Now seeing how it’s taken off, I don’t have any worries about the league being around — I just don’t know where I’m going to be at in my stage of life.”Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about foreign players in the National Women’s Hockey League misidentified, in some copies, the player who said that joining the league had been a rewarding experience and that her $15,000 salary had its limits. She is Sydney Kidd, not Ashley Johnston.A version of this article appears in print on March 5, 2016, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Obstacles for Global Talent in Women’s League.
