Barcelona stumbled for a third straight match in its quest to defend its Spanish league title with a 1-0 loss at Real Sociedad on Saturday, letting Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid tighten the race even further.Barcelona had 84 minutes to turn around Mikel Oyarzabal’s opening goal, but a stagnant attack in the first half and goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli’s late saves, denying Lionel Messi, guaranteed some drama for the season’s end.A middling team in La Liga for several seasons, Sociedad once again proved to be a nemesis for Barcelona, which left Anoeta Stadium without a victory for a sixth consecutive time.Barcelona’s latest loss in San Sebastián came after Atlético fought back at Espanyol to win, 3-1, and Cristiano Ronaldo led host Madrid’s 4-0 rout of Eibar.AdvertisementTwo rounds ago, Barcelona was 9 points ahead after a draw at Villarreal, and the title race appeared to be all but decided. Now, after losses to Madrid and Sociedad, Barcelona’s lead has dwindled to 3 points over Atlético and 4 over Madrid with six rounds left.AdvertisementBarcelona had not gone three league games without a win since May 2014 and had not lost two straight rounds since November of last season.“We had built up a cushion of points so we could, let’s say, allow ourselves to have some setbacks,” Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta said. “And now we have allowed about all we can.”A BLOW FOR ARSENAL Arsenal needed a flawless finish to the Premier League season to stand a realistic chance of reeling in the surprise leader, Leicester.Thanks to West Ham striker Andy Carroll, that will not be happening.Carroll scored an eight-minute hat trick as West Ham came from two goals behind and drew, 3-3, with visiting Arsenal in a wild match at Upton Park.Only second-place Tottenham now has a realistic chance of stopping Leicester.Arsenal is 10 points behind the leader and 3 behind Spurs, with the top two in action on Sunday.Arsenal is not yet assured of securing a top-four place and a Champions League berth for next season, with Manchester City only 2 points back in fourth after rallying for a 2-1 victory over visiting West Bromwich Albion.Manchester United is 4 points behind City, with its game in hand coming against Tottenham on Sunday.Last-place Aston Villa’s relegation was delayed at least another week, despite its 2-1 loss at home to Bournemouth, its 23rd in 33 league matches this season. Norwich could have relegated Villa by picking up a point at Crystal Palace, but it lost, 1-0.AdvertisementIt was Palace’s first win since Dec. 19, virtually ensuring its Premier League status for another season.Newcastle appeared likely to join Villa in the second tier after losing, 3-1, at Southampton to remain 6 points behind Norwich with six matches left.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
