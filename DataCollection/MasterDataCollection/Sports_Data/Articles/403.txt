FOXBOROUGH, Mass. —  The last three weeks exposed women’s hockey to the hard business dealings of professional sports, along with its hierarchies and the need for more collaboration to advance the sport.After much confusion and delay, the lessons learned paid off with a seminal moment on Thursday afternoon, when the Boston Pride of the National Women’s Hockey League and Les Canadiennes of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League played outdoors at Gillette Stadium as part of the N.H.L.’s Winter Classic festivities.The teams tied, 1-1, in a fast-paced contest. But an event that was already heavily scrutinized for its structure received another setback when a player was injured on ice conditions that had been questioned earlier in the day.Late in the first period, Denna Laing stepped on a stick and lost her footing as she went crashing into the boards, according to Pride Coach Bobby Jay. Replays were unavailable, since the game was not broadcast live.AdvertisementAfter about 10 minutes, Laing was placed on a stretcher, taken off the ice and transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, nearly 30 miles away.AdvertisementBefore the women’s game, the Montreal Canadiens and the Boston Bruins practiced for Friday’s N.H.L. Winter Classic, and some players saw slushy and dangerous patches of ice. Laing’s injury occurred behind the net on an end of the rink where the sun was shining for much of the afternoon.After the game, Patrick Burke, the N.H.L. director of player safety, said that Dan Craig, a league official who oversaw the playing surface, had said the ice was fine.The injury was a somber moment in a game that was intended to be a landmark, but at times was overshadowed by planning snafus.After a report surfaced on Dec. 5 that an outdoor women’s hockey game was going to take place the day before the Winter Classic, the organizers said nothing until the N.H.L. officially announced the game on Monday.During the silence, fans and even players were unsure of the details and baffled at how a formative opportunity might slip away. Sponsorship debates and fractures between influential hockey organizations were clouding negotiations and adding to the worry.“It’s super frustrating,” Pride forward Rachel Llanes said on Sunday before the official announcement. “I mean, not being informed pretty much about it, we’re getting informed last second with things, we don’t know the answers to our questions. We’re not trying to blame anyone, because no one knows anything and the N.H.L. hasn’t even released anything about it, so it’s just frustrating to hear it from the grapevines what’s going to happen.”After the Pride’s lone practice for the game on Wednesday, Jay said the players were realizing that business decisions occasionally outweigh hockey decisions.Advertisement“Now that you’re a professional, you’re going to start to see the business side of it — it’s not always the prettiest side,” Jay said. “They’re going through it for the first time, some of these things; they kind of can be pawns sometimes.”Those business decisions included no streaming or television options, even though other events throughout the day, including the N.H.L.’s alumni game, were broadcast live.At times, the day felt like a full-fledged marquee event, except for the women’s game. Parking at Gillette Stadium cost $50. The pregame festivities for the alumni game lasted almost as long as the women’s game, which included two 15-minute periods played on a running clock.The alumni game was allowed an overtime shootout when their contest finished tied after regulation. During the women’s game, the N.H.L.’s official Twitter and Facebook pages did not provide any original content about it.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

C.W.H.L. Commissioner Brenda Andress and N.W.H.L. Commissioner Dani Rylan took photographs together before the game.The two leagues have never declared themselves rivals, but they have had a less than amicable relationship since the N.W.H.L. formed last March and became the first major North American women’s hockey league to pay its players.

The C.W.H.L., in its ninth season, does not pay its players, and it lost several top American players to the N.W.H.L. this season. Both leagues field premier talent — N.C.A.A. stars and members of the United States national team buoy the N.W.H.L., while the C.W.H.L. is led by players from the defending Olympic champion Canadian national team.Earlier this week, Andress said in a phone interview that she believed more collaboration was necessary to grow the sport.AdvertisementThe game lost some luster because of the absence of members of the Pride who had a previous commitment to a United States national team training camp, including stars like Hilary Knight, Brianna Decker and Kacey Bellamy. Laing was one of eight players selected from the Pride practice squad or other N.W.H.L. teams as a replacement.In an interview with the Yahoo blog Puck Daddy, Burke said that U.S.A. Hockey had declined to let its players out for an exhibition. Earlier this month, U.S.A. Hockey did not respond to an email for comment.Llanes said that despite the advent of two viable professional women’s hockey leagues, U.S.A. Hockey retained overwhelming influence over the sport’s future.“Unfortunately, that’s women’s hockey right now,” Llanes said. “I think top priority for anyone in the women’s game is the Olympic team, whether it’s U.S.A. or Canada.”She added, “I don’t think we’re all on the same page right now at different levels of the game.”Earlier this month, the United States women’s national soccer team successfully protested against playing on unfit field conditions, taking a stand against U.S. Soccer, which, like U.S.A. Hockey, is the commanding presence in the sport.It is debatable whether playing in an exhibition game is currently worth losing a roster spot on a national team, but those involved in the Outdoor Women’s Classic hoped that the event was a step toward bringing women’s professional hockey on equal footing.“As it goes, the women will understand that they have some leverage,” Jay said. “They have to look out for themselves. You have to make sure you’re doing what’s best for yourself. I just think they got put in the middle and didn’t really have much — it’s a tough choice.“Off the ice, there are business aspects that are a little bit out of your control, and money’s a factor and sometimes political reasons that things don’t always go your way and you’re going to have to learn how to manage those, too.”A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Ice Problems and Injury Plague Women’s Debut at the Winter Classic .
