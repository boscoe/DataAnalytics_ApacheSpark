The N.F.L.’s senior vice president for health and safety, Jeff Miller, acknowledged on Monday a link between football-related concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.In perhaps its clearest admission that football can cause degenerative brain disease, the N.F.L.’s top health and safety official admitted Monday that there was a link between the sport and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease found in dozens of retired players.In a round-table discussion on Capitol Hill, Jeff Miller, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for health and safety policy, was asked by Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, whether “there is a link between football and degenerative brain disorders like C.T.E.”“The answer to that is certainly, yes,” Miller said.Miller went on to say that Dr. Ann McKee and her colleagues at Boston University had found the disease in many players who died. The disease, which is diagnosed only posthumously, can be identified by a buildup of a tau protein in parts of the brain. Miller said that there were still questions about the prevalence of the disease.
                Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease, has been found in dozens of former N.F.L. players. Here are some of the most notable cases, along with New York Times coverage.            For years, the N.F.L. denied there was any relationship between tackle football and long-term brain disease. Ms. Schakowsky said that the “N.F.L. has a very troubling track record of denying and discrediting scientific inquiry into the risks of playing football.”AdvertisementIn 2009, a league spokesman told The New York Times that it was “quite obvious from the medical research that’s been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems.”AdvertisementThe league soon stepped back from that position. Commissioner Roger Goodell has said repeatedly that it would let the medical community determine the connection between football and C.T.E.“We want the facts, so we can develop better solutions,” said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman. “And that’s why we’re deeply committed to advancing medical research on head trauma, including C.T.E., to let the science go where the science goes. We know the answers will come as this field of study continues to advance.”In a settlement with thousands of retired N.F.L. players, the league has agreed to pay damages to the families of those who were found to have the disease between 2006 and last April, when the settlement was approved by a district court judge.Some players have appealed the settlement because they argue that players found with C.T.E. in the future should also be paid. Lawyers for the objectors quickly seized on the N.F.L.’s admission.In a letter sent early Tuesday morning to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which is considering the players’ appeal, Steven Molo, their lawyer, said Mr. Miller’s comments on Capitol Hill are “a stark turn from its position before the district court,” when the N.F.L. relied on experts to dismiss the significance of Dr. McKee’s research.“The N.F.L.’s statements make clear that the N.F.L. now accepts what science already knows: a ‘direct link’ exists between traumatic brain injury and C.T.E. Given that, the settlement’s failure to compensate present and future C.T.E. is inexcusable.”A panel of three judges heard appeals of the settlement, including those by Mr. Molo, in November. There is no timetable for when the judges may rule.A version of this article appears in print on March 15, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: N.F.L.
