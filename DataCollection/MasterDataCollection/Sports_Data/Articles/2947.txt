PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. —  The four older gentlemen, fans with field passes, were standing by the Mets’ dugout Wednesday morning when Curtis Granderson, bat in hand, bounded down the steps after taking swings in the batting cage for his spring training debut.Granderson had a bounce in his step, a smile to match, par for the daily course. One of the men, sensing an approachable vibe, struck up a conversation. He asked Granderson his age — “Turning 35,” he said, cheerily — and about the differences between playing for the Yankees, Wednesday’s visitors to Tradition Field, and the Mets.“I enjoyed my time with the Yankees and I’m enjoying my time with the Mets,” he said, before signing balls and posing for photos.What sounded like the polite response bordering on cliché was actually the God’s honest truth.“I’ve never seen the kid in a bad mood,” said Kevin Long, the Mets’ hitting coach since last season, who also worked with Granderson with the Yankees.AdvertisementLong is 49, so maybe 35 — Granderson’s birthday is March 16 — still qualifies him as a “kid.” It could also be based on an attitude seldom straying from upbeat.Advertisement“I’ve never seen him come to the field looking discouraged,” Long said. “I’ve never seen him with his head down. I’ve never seen him anything but positive. We laugh all the time when we say, you know, does Curtis ever have a bad day?”These days, why would he?Granderson is the guy who bought a bottomed-out stock and watched it turn into a raging bull. He is a home buyer who got a deal in a blighted area of the city and woke up one morning not long after to discover that gentrification had quadrupled its market value.We are, of course, taking measure of Granderson’s quality of baseball life, not his paycheck ($60 million over four years), which wouldn’t have changed had the Mets remained a fixer-upper instead of ascending to the National League penthouse last season, Granderson’s second in Queens after four in the Bronx with the Yankees.Not that the Yankees were remotely dynastic during Granderson’s time lofting fly balls into the Yankee Stadium right-field jet stream, but they did make the postseason in three of those four years and Granderson twice played in the American League Championship Series.For a player generally well liked by his peers and the news media, there was a degree of pity for him — $60 million and all — about having to relocate to the Mets. To begin with, Citi Field at the time was a major league mausoleum. On a personal performance level, it was also where long fly balls habitually settled into outfield gloves.After a two-hit, five-inning performance in right field as the Mets and the Yankees played to a 4-4, 10-inning tie, Granderson naturally had a rose-colored view of the transition through eyes recently recovered from an irritation that sidelined him for the first week of games.“Getting a chance to become a free agent — everybody looks forward to getting an opportunity hopefully to select where you want to go,” he said. “The Mets showed a lot of interest early on. I was happy because of that, and the things they talked about actually lived up to, in terms of the arms, in terms of the good guys, in terms of the winning building in.”AdvertisementHe mentioned some of the pitching maturations, the roster additions, the financial calculations — all coalescing in the second year of his contract, making him the embodiment of the new order of the city’s 2016 baseball expectations, a years-in-the-making change in atmospheric conditions.The Mets-Yankees dynamic does not yet qualify as a reversal of fortune because the Yankees, given the proper alignment of planets and pitchers, could still be an American League force.

But once installed by Manager Terry Collins as the leadoff hitter — practically by default — Granderson provided the necessary patience to go along with the anticipated power.He hit .259, 28 home runs, with 70 R.B.I., walking 91 times for an on-base percentage of .364.“He sees a lot of pitches, swings only at strikes, he gets on base, has got some pop,” said Long, who cited a two-out, seventh-inning walk off Clayton Kershaw to load the bases in Game 1 of the National League division series as a prime example of Granderson’s value.The score was 1-1 and Granderson’s patience led to the removal of Kershaw for Pedro Baez, who surrendered a decisive two-run single to David Wright.“It was just a walk, but it was overlooked, much like Curtis often can be,” Long said.Not here. Not now. Not anymore, as the leader and leadoff man for the National League champions and, until proven otherwise, No. 1 team in New York.A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2016, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: As Mets Rise, Granderson Has Even More Reason to Be Upbeat .
