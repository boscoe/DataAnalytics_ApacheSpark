ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — When Manager Joe Girardi arrived at the pitcher’s mound with an outstretched hand, reliever Nick Goody placed the baseball in it.But as Goody began the walk back to the dugout, Girardi went the same way. When Goody recoiled and stepped the other way, so did Girardi, and they bumped into each other.It was that kind of afternoon for the Yankees as they lost to the Tampa Bay Rays, 9-5, on Saturday: They could not get out of their own way.Nobody hindered the cause more than Michael Pineda, who after an encouraging performance last Sunday at Oakland reverted to dispiriting form with his briefest outing this season.AdvertisementPineda gave up three runs in another rough first inning — his season-long bugaboo — and allowed a two-run homer by Evan Longoria in the second.

But fitting for the Yankees’ afternoon, he left the game shortly afterward when a muscle in his upper back knotted up while he was checking his swing.Alex Rodriguez, another aging slugger, dropped to 1 for 13, with seven strikeouts, since returning Thursday from three weeks on the disabled list, his only hit a monstrous home run on Friday night. On Saturday, with the bases loaded, he chased a fastball from Enny Romero to end the seventh.The Yankees had another prime opportunity in the eighth, cutting their deficit to 9-5, but Jacoby Ellsbury and Aaron Hicks grounded out with two runners aboard.A version of this article appears in print on May 29, 2016, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Fail to Recover After Pineda’s Early Exit.
