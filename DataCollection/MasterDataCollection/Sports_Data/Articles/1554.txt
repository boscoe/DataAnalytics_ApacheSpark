ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — Germany capitalized on an awful mistake and survived a whirlwind assault by Chile to claim a 1-0 victory in a pulsating, bad-tempered Confederations Cup final on Sunday.Germany, which won the title for the first time, got the only goal of the game from Lars Stindl in the 20th minute when Chile midfielder Marcelo Díaz gave the ball away on the edge of his own penalty area.“I’m immensely proud of this team, because they have been together for only three and half weeks,” Germany’s coach, Joachim Löw, said.Löw brought a young, experimental team to the competition, leaving behind players such as Manuel Neuer, Jérôme Boateng, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller. The average age of the German team at the Confederations Cup was just over 24, compared with an average of over 30 for Chile.Advertisement“The fact that these young players have won this tournament makes it an historic achievement,” Löw said. “It’s unique in Germany’s history, it’s outstanding.”AdvertisementChile, playing with its usual high-octane style and driven forward by another relentless performance by Arturo Vidal, dominated the match but was let down by poor finishing.The game featured missed chances, defensive miscues, scuffles and two video reviews, including one that produced a controversial decision in the second half.Chile defender Gonzalo Jara elbowed Timo Werner by the sideline and the Serbian referee Milorad Mazic, alerted by the video assistants, let Jara off with a yellow card instead of a red. Shortly afterward, Mazic turned down Chile’s appeals for a penalty and stood by his decision after another review — and booked Chile’s Eduardo Vargas for drawing an imaginary television screen.It was a remarkable achievement for Germany to lift the trophy with such a relatively inexperienced squad, although it could also be a bad omen: No team has won the World Cup after winning the Confederations Cup the year before.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
