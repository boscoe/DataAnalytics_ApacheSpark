RIO DE JANEIRO — When the United States captured the women’s World Cup in 2015, it won every game it played — with one exception. That was the first-round game against Sweden that ended in a 0-0 tie, a contest that the Americans might have lost if not for a leaping effort by the shortest player on the team, the 5-foot-2 Meghan Klingenberg, who somehow headed away a Swedish shot fired on the net.On Friday afternoon, the United States and Sweden will meet again, but this time in Brasília, not in Canada. And this time, the stakes will be higher because whoever loses this Olympics quarterfinal will be out of the tournament.To a certain extent, this game would seem to be a mismatch. The United States, the defending Olympic and Women’s World Cup champion, went undefeated in group play, beating New Zealand and a formidable France team. The Americans then stumbled to a frustrating tie against Colombia, a game in which Coach Jill Ellis, assured of advancing, fiddled with her lineup and rested several key players.In contrast, Sweden squeezed into the quarterfinals in unimpressive fashion, beating South Africa, 1-0; getting steamrollered by Brazil, 5-1; and then playing a scoreless tie with China. The Swedes have played just well enough to advance as one of the two third-place teams needed to fill out the quarterfinals.AdvertisementStill, Friday’s game could hinge on two key figures: Sweden Coach Pia Sundhage, who knows the Americans well from five years as their coach, and United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, whose two blunders against Colombia were a rare sign of concern for a player who has been a fixture in the American lineup for years.AdvertisementAgainst Colombia on Tuesday, Solo had one of the worst games in her long career, making two embarrassing mistakes on free kicks. On the first, she let a shot skip between her legs for Colombia’s first goal. On the second, in the game’s dying moments, she failed to make adequate contact on another curling free kick as she jumped to block it, and could only watch as it sailed past her into the net to tie the score.

After Tuesday’s mistakes, some are wondering whether the hostile treatment is starting to get to her.Solo avoided reporters immediately after Tuesday’s game but later told Sports Illustrated that she was taking the mistakes in stride.“It happens,’’ she told SI.com. “These things happen.

Before the World Cup, the free-spirited Sundhage had given an interview to The New York Times in which she created a stir with some comments critical of Lloyd, whom she described as a “challenge to coach.’’“When she felt that we had faith in her, she could be one of the best players,’’ Sundhage said at the time. “But if she began to question that faith, she could be one of the worst.’’Lloyd, who is now the United States captain, disputed that assessment at the time and went on to have an outstanding World Cup, scoring three goals in the final and being named the tournament’s outstanding player.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
