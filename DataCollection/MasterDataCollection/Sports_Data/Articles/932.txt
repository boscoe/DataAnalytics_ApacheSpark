Instead, Judge Camille Buras allowed Hayes to serve his sentences at the same time.AdvertisementHayes, 29, a former semiprofessional football player, apologized for the April 2016 shooting but maintained that he had feared for his life.Hayes said he had shot in self-defense after Smith fired a gun at him, but no other witness or evidence supported his claim. A handgun was found in Smith’s car, but it had not been fired.Smith was shot eight times, seven in the back, after Hayes crashed his sport utility vehicle into Smith’s car. Surveillance video from before the confrontation showed Smith’s Mercedes possibly bumping Hayes’s Hummer, then driving away.A version of this article appears in print on April 21, 2017, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline:  Patriots Will Host Chiefs in N.F.L.
