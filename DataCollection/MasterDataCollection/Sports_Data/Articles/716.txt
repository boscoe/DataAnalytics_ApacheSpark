Alabama-Birmingham Coach Bill Clark said that running back Greg Bryant was “still fighting for his life” after having been shot in South Florida.Bryant was in critical condition at St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla.The university had issued statements from Clark, President Ray Watt and Athletic Director Mark Ingram saying that Bryant had died. Clark said those condolences “were based on information a family member at the hospital provided and gave us permission to release.”Bryant is the biggest name in U.A.B.’s first recruiting class since the football program was reinstated.He left Notre Dame after one season when he was ruled academically ineligible for the 2015 season. Because U.A.B. will not play again until the 2017 season, Bryant was allowed to enroll in January 2016 instead of possibly having to wait an extra year to become eligible elsewhere.A version of this brief appears in print on May 8, 2016, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | College Football; Alabama-Birmingham Running Back Is Shot.
