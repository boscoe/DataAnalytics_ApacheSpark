But it took a deadline for the sides to set aside their differences and reach a long-term extension.A stalemate that lasted more than two years, and which seemed certain to endure past Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline for teams to sign franchise players to multiyear deals, ended with a contract that tethers Wilkerson, one of the best defensive linemen in the N.F.L., to the Jets for five more years.The Jets announced the deal about 30 minutes after the deadline had passed. Had the Jets not reached an agreement with him, Wilkerson, 26, would have had two options this season: playing for the $15.7 million tag or, less likely, not playing at all.Wilkerson and the organization had disagreed on his value since before Mike Maccagnan was hired as general manager in January 2015, and with the stalemate having lasted deep into this week, it seemed as if the Jets were resigned, in all likelihood, to losing a homegrown star to free agency after the season. But the sides bridged the chasm, and Wilkerson will remain along with two other first-round draft picks, Sheldon Richardson and Leonard Williams, to form one of the league’s most formidable defensive lines for this season and beyond.“I give my all every Sunday on the field and play with so much love and passion for the game,” Wilkerson said on Twitter. “I’m thankful for everything that comes my way and proud to say I’m back on the green and white for a few more years.”The extension — for $86 million, with $54 million guaranteed, according to CBS Sports — resembles the free-agent deal Olivier Vernon signed with the Giants in March. The Jets had expressed interest in Vernon, as well, but Wilkerson, to them, is more of a known commodity.The Jets’ first-round pick in 2012, Wilkerson has anchored the defensive line the last few seasons, registering a career-high 12 sacks in 2015 and making his first Pro Bowl.With Wilkerson locked up, the Jets have one more priority before training camp begins July 27: re-signing last year’s starting quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick.He and the Jets have differed on his worth since free agency began in March. But if Wilkerson and the Jets could reach a compromise after more than two years, then perhaps there is hope for Fitzpatrick.Advertisement
