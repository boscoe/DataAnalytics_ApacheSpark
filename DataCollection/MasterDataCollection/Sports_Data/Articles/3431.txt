Pregnant women should consider not traveling to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro because of the risk of Zika virus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.The C.D.C. also said that women considering becoming pregnant, and their male partners, should exercise caution if they travel to the Olympics or the Paralympic Games, scheduled for Rio in August and September.The statement is the C.D.C.’s first explicit warning for some travelers to stay away from the Games. Organizers expect as many as 400,000 tourists from around the world.Athletes have said they are concerned about Zika, a virus that has been linked in Brazil to microcephaly, a rare condition that causes abnormally small heads in infants and can lead to developmental problems.But even as athletes express worries about Zika, the organizing committee for the Games said it would charge national delegations to have mosquito screens on athletes’ rooms.The screens, one measure Brazilians are using to help ward off the mosquito that is the primary transmitter of Zika, will be installed in communal areas “where required,” but affixed to lodging only if national delegations decide to pay for it, said Philip Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee.A version of this article appears in print on February 27, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Avoid Travel to Olympics If Pregnant, U.S. Warns.
