SEATTLE — Follow our live N.F.L. playoffs coverage here.The formula that has led the Seattle Seahawks to consistent success over the past five seasons returned.A healthy dose of rumbling on the ground, this time by Thomas Rawls. A few timely throws by Russell Wilson, along with some remarkable catches. And a defense that never allowed Detroit to sniff the end zone.Rawls set a franchise playoff record with 161 rushing yards, Paul Richardson made one of the catches of the year for a touchdown, and the Seahawks beat the Lions, 26-6, on Saturday in an N.F.C. wild-card game.Seattle won its 10th straight home playoff game, while Detroit extended its lengthy postseason drought: The Lions have no playoff wins since 1992 and no road playoff wins since 1957.
                Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. has compiled a highlight reel of spectacular grabs. But what sets Beckham apart is not that he holds onto the football. It’s what happens after the ball is in his hands.            Seattle (11-5-1) must now travel to Atlanta to face the Falcons in a divisional-round game.Rawls was the workhorse for a running game that was missing consistency all season, the first since Marshawn Lynch retired. Rawls had runs of 12, 14, 26 and 32 yards, his longest run coming with Wilson as his lead blocker.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We want to end with a great mark running the football, which is our identity, playing tough, hard-nosed Seahawks football, and that’s exactly what we did.”AdvertisementWhile Rawls did the grunt work, Richardson filled the highlight reel with a trio of catches. None was better than his 2-yard touchdown in the second quarter, which gave Seattle a 7-0 lead.As Richardson leapt in the end zone, he reached out with his left hand to cradle the ball despite contact from Lions safety Tavon Wilson. Richardson’s right hand was busy yanking on Wilson’s face mask, but no penalty was called.Richardson had another one-handed catch in the fourth quarter, and Doug Baldwin got into the act by pinning a 10-yard reception to the back of his leg late in the fourth quarter. Two plays later, a 13-yard touchdown reception by Baldwin, who had 11 catches for 104 yards, put the game away.Overshadowed by the offensive performance was Seattle’s defense, which prevented Detroit from running a play inside the Seattle 33-yard line. Hampered by a handful of dropped passes and some untimely penalties, the Lions (9-8) could manage only two long Matt Prater field goals.“We definitely knew if we came in and focused, we’d be fine,” the All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner said. “We knew they got some great players on the other end, but we were just locked in all week and we prepared very well.”A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2017, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Seahawks Display Flair  in Workmanlike Victory.
