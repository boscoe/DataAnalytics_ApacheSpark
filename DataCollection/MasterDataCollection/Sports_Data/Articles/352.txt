Professional drivers raced around Red Hook, Brooklyn, at 140 miles an hour this weekend, but their cars moved with more of a whir than a roar. On Saturday and Sunday, Formula E came to Brooklyn for the first time. While the cars looked and performed like the open-wheel speedsters you would see in Indianapolis or Monaco, they ran on electricity.The Formula E circuit is in its third year of bringing electric car racing to the heart of big cities around the world.  In previous races, the cars have zipped around Les Invalides in Paris and Red Square in Moscow.But New York City raised the series to a new level in many drivers’ eyes. “It’s amazing,” said Nelson Piquet Jr., the champion of the series’ first season.  “New York is the capital of the world. It’s always been the dream to have a race over here, for everybody.”Sam Bird of Britain won on both Saturday and Sunday.Missing was the ear-splitting noise that fans of Formula One, IndyCar or enduros are used to. Normally at a car race, you know you’re at a car race: The painfully piercing sound leads many fans to turn up with noise-canceling earphones.At Formula E, the noise is more like a low whine; it’s an almost eerie feeling when cars race by with nearly no aural warning.Halfway through the race came something else followers of traditional car racing are not used to. Because the racers cannot make it the 50 miles on a single charge – and because watching cars slowly juice up would be dull for spectators – drivers execute a car switch halfway through the race, exiting their depleted vehicles and leaping into fully charged replacements. “It’s not easy,” Piquet said. “The cars are pretty tight.”And yes, for the safety conscious, the drivers do rebuckle.
