The Super Bowl’s most valuable player, Von Miller, has been tagged as a franchise player, though, and will not be going anywhere.The Carolina Panthers, who lost, 24-10, to Denver in the Super Bowl, retained the All-Pro fullback Mike Tolbert and re-signed defensive end Charles Johnson to a lower salary on Wednesday.In other major moves on the first day of free agency, the All-Pro running back Doug Martin re-signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for five years, the Indianapolis Colts released the veteran receiver Andre Johnson, and center Alex Mack chose the Atlanta Falcons over the Cleveland Browns.Charles Johnson, 29, would have cost the Panthers $15 million in 2016 under the cap before he was cut. He played nine seasons with Carolina, and his sack total (63$) is the second highest in franchise history, behind Julius Peppers’s 81.Tolbert also said he accepted less money to return to Carolina.The top player at his position on the market, Martin is set to get more than $35 million, with $15 million guaranteed, from the Buccaneers.The Tennessee Titans also agreed to terms with Texans offensive lineman Ben Jones and the veteran quarterback Matt Cassel, according to multiple news reports, and the Oakland Raiders signed Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin to a four-year deal, according to multiple news reports.Headed to the Miami Dolphins from the Buffalo Bills was defensive end Mario Williams, who got $17 million over two years.Advertisement
