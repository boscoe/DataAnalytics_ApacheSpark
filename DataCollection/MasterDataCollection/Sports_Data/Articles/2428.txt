AUGUSTA, Ga. — Since Lexi Thompson lost in a playoff Sunday in the first women’s major of the year after receiving four penalty strokes for a day-old infraction brought to the L.P.G.A.’s attention by a television viewer, a debate has raged about whether armchair rules officials should be able to offer input.Rory McIlroy, voicing an opinion popular among touring professionals, noted on Tuesday that there is no other sport in which people can email or contact officials about a missed call — much less affect a competition the day after the fact.“I think Tiger said it best,” McIlroy said, referring to an online posting by Tiger Woods. “People at home don’t need to be wearing striped shirts. They don’t need to be calling in and officiating us.”Phil Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion, however, turned the onus back on the players. He suggested that some players intentionally put their ball back in the wrong spot to gain a competitive advantage. (Thompson was penalized for replacing her ball about a half-inch from its original spot during the third round, which she said was an accident.)Advertisement“I know a number of guys on tour that are loose with how they mark the ball and have not been called on it,” Mickelson said. “I mean, they will move the ball two, three inches in front of their mark, and this is an intentional way to get it out of any type of impression and so forth, and I think that kind of stuff needs to stop.”Mickelson added that the players should not be the ones responsible for monitoring one another.“I think that the tour should go to those players and say, ‘Look, we’ve noticed you’ve been a little lax in how precise you’ve been in marking the ball. We’d like you to be a little better at it,’” he said.After Thompson, 22, was notified of her four-stroke penalty — two for the bad mark and two for signing an incorrect scorecard — at the ANA Inspiration, many golfers took to Twitter to explain that it is virtually impossible to place a ball back in the exact original position.AdvertisementIn his pre-Masters news conference, Mickelson said, “I feel like we’ve all kind of been a little lax at times in the marking of our golf ball, and I hate to see it cost somebody a major championship.”He added: “To have a tournament be decided like that, with all the scenarios going around as far as viewers calling in, as far as it being a one-foot putt with really no advantage, just a little bit of a loose marking, if you will — something that happens all the time, intentionally and unintentionally — I just think it should be reversed. I think that she should be given the trophy.”A LIFT FOR SPIETH’S CONFIDENCE On the par-3 12th hole during a practice round, the 2015 champion Jordan Spieth hit his tee shot to within a foot of the pin. It was the first time he had played the hole in front of a large audience since the fourth round of last year’s Masters, when he deposited two balls in the water on his way to a quadruple bogey that helped deliver the tournament to Danny Willett.Spieth, who finished tied for second, said he turned to the crowd and said, “I really could have used that one 12 months ago.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He talked as if Tuesday’s trip around Amen Corner was also cathartic.“I stepped up today, first day back with the crowds, and I hit it to about a foot, which is nice,” Spieth said, adding: “Game feels good. We’ll step out and try and get a chance to win on Sunday on the back nine again. That’s all we’re asking for.”ANOTHER SPIETH’S DREAM If Wednesday’s par-3 contest does not get rained out, Spieth’s younger brother, Steven, will make his Augusta National debut as a caddie. Steven Spieth, a senior at Brown University who averaged 17.3 points for the basketball team this season, has never been able to attend the Masters because of his school schedule.Spieth’s brother, a 6-foot-6 left-hander, intends to pursue a professional basketball career overseas, but he has a more pressing goal at the moment: take a shot on the par-3 course.“I’m not sure, this is up to the green jackets here if you’re allowed to,” Jordan Spieth said, sneaking a glance at the Augusta National member moderating his news conference, “but honestly, my brother will probably take it anyway.”AdvertisementVERBAL TIPTOEING Augusta National is particular about its tournament: No running is allowed on the grounds, no cellphones are allowed on the course, and there are no spectators — only patrons. The myriad rules had Spieth looking over his shoulder during his news conference, and not just when asked if his brother would be hitting a shot in the par-3 contest.Asked about a round he played here recently with Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback and Super Bowl most valuable player, Spieth looked at the moderator and said, “I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say.”The moderator returned his gaze before looking out at the auditorium full of reporters and saying, “Next question.”Then, in response to a question about McIlroy, Spieth again looked at the moderator and asked, “Can I say ‘badass’ here?”Laughing, the moderator said, “You just did.”A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2017, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Thompson’s Four-Stroke Penalty Remains the Talk of Augusta.
