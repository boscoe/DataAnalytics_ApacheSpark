Saul extended Atlético’s overall lead in the 26th minute, heading it home powerfully off Filipe Luís’s superb cross.Leicester City, the Premier League champions who were in their first Champions League campaign, responded strongly, dominating the second half. Vardy tied it in the 61st minute after Ben Chilwell’s shot was blocked, but it was not quite enough.Advertisement
