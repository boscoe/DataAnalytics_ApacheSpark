Novak Djokovic, a three-time defending champion, lost in the Paris Masters quarterfinals on Friday, leaving his No. 1 ranking open to being snatched by Andy Murray. Murray can rise from No. 2 to No. 1 in the ATP list for the first time if he reaches the final. He beat No. 11 Tomas Berdych, 7-6 (9), 7-5, to reach the semifinal, where his opponent will be Milos Raonic.Murray was sometimes hesitant against Berdych. He rallied from 6-1 down in the tiebreaker and needed four match points to overcome the Czech.Djokovic, so dominant on the Parisian red clay last June in winning his first French Open to complete a career grand slam, was far from his best on the superfast carpet at the Masters and was beaten by Marin Cilic, 6-4, 7-6 (2), his first loss in 15 matches against Cilic. Hampered by a lingering injury to his right hand, Djokovic made uncharacteristic mistakes from the baseline, called the tournament doctor during the first set, struggled with consistency on his serve and destroyed his hopes of a comeback when he served for the second set at 5-4, hit two double faults and was broken. Cilic, who struck nine aces over all, served extremely well to prevail in the tiebreaker and end Djokovic’s 17-match winning streak in Paris.Djokovic has held the top spot for 122 consecutive weeks. But his form has been erratic over the past few months, and he did not play in Paris with the confidence he showed here last year, when he crushed Murray, 6-2, 6-4, in the final.AdvertisementIf he wins the title, Murray, who has spent 76 weeks at No. 2, would become the 26th player to reach No. 1 since the rankings started in 1973.Advertisement“He’s definitely a player who deserves that,” Djokovic said. “Undoubtedly, much respect for what he has done. We have known each other since very, very early days. We were, I think, 11 years old when we first played against each other. And to see how he has raised his level in the last 12 months is quite extraordinary.”In a semifinal on Saturday, Murray will face the fourth-seeded Raonic, who defeated Tsonga, 6-2, 7-6 (4).Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Isner won a hard-fought, all-American contest against Jack Sock, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-4, after throwing a tantrum over a foot-fault call in the second set.The N.F.L. said it was fining Green Bay linebacker Datone Jones $36,464 for his roughing-the-passer penalty against Atlanta.Jones is a repeat offender, resulting in the large fine imposed by the league. On Sunday, Jones hit Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan in the first half of Atlanta’s 33-32 victory.Cincinnati’s Shawn Williams was docked $24,309 for spearing, a result of a hit on Washington’s DeSean Jackson during the teams’ 27-27 tie in London on Sunday.Also fined $24,309 for unnecessary-roughness penalties last weekend were Detroit’s Tavon Wilson and Oakland’s Karl Joseph. The Raiders’ Donald Penn was also hit with an $18,231 fine for unnecessary roughness, while Michael Crabtree was fined $9,115 for taunting.AdvertisementAROUND THE N.F.L. The Pittsburgh Steelers listed quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as questionable for Sunday’s game against the Baltimore Ravens as he recovered from an Oct. 17 operation to repair a meniscus tear in his left knee.  Cleveland Browns Coach Hue Jackson announced that rookie Cody Kessler would start at quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys. Kessler missed the Browns’ game against the Jets last Sunday because of a concussion. Josh McCown started that game but will return to the backup role. Jackson said he hoped Kessler could keep the starting job for the rest of the season to show whether he can be the Browns quarterback of the future.  The Denver Broncos will be without cornerback Aqib Talib for the second consecutive game as his back injury continues to fail to respond to treatment.
