ANAHEIM, Calif. — At the dawn of the men’s college basketball season, the Pacific-12 was considered in many circles to be the sport’s premier conference. And despite legions of doubters east of its time zone, the league entered the N.C.A.A. tournament with seven invitees and a No. 2 ranking in the respected rating percentage index, or R.P.I.One by one, though, Pac-12 teams have fallen, leaving Oregon as the conference’s last remaining representative in the tournament.By thrashing Duke, 82-68, in a West Regional semifinal on Thursday night, Oregon stands one victory from ending a dry spell of more than 75 years since a visit to the Final Four. The Ducks won the inaugural N.C.A.A. tournament in 1939.Now the No. 1-seeded Ducks are halfway to hoisting their second national championship flag. Their next opponent: second-seeded Oklahoma on Saturday in the regional final.Advertisement“They were the better team — that was pretty obvious tonight,” Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “They were an old, extremely well-coached team. Great athletes playing together, and they knocked us back. They were always in control of the game.”AdvertisementThere was a home-court feel for Oregon at Honda Center — the Ducks have six players from Southern California.
                Kansas, North Carolina, Virginia and Oregon are the top seeds in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament.            Jordan Bell, one of the Californians, contributed 13 points and 3 blocked shots, and Dillon Brooks led the team with 22 points and added 6 assists.“He’s a terrific player,” Krzyzewski said of Brooks. “He makes their team go. He doesn’t have a position. He plays all positions, and he plays them so strong.”Just as impactful was Oregon’s defense against Grayson Allen, who had amassed 54 points in two previous tournament games. Allen scored 3 points in the first half and finished with 15.Duke’s Brandon Ingram, a freshman, had some highlight baskets and led the team with 24 points, but his performance was not enough. For the most part, the Blue Devils were engulfed by Oregon’s athleticism and sharpshooting.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Blue Devils eventually warmed up, stringing together 7 straight points to nose ahead, 27-26, and the game, expected to be free-flowing, had found its crowd-pleasing groove.That was the last time the Blue Devils had the lead. They hit a rut and entered halftime trailing by 36-31.AdvertisementIt could have been worse. Duke fell into an early bind when center Marshall Plumlee committed a charge, his second foul of the game, just over five minutes into the first half. Underscoring the Devils’ lack of depth, Plumlee sat out for only four minutes, and he stayed out of foul trouble the rest of the way.But Plumlee had a minimal effect on the game as Duke was outrebounded, 42-32.Oregon withstood the one-two punch from Allen and Ingram at the start of the second half and broadened its lead to double digits, topping out at 16 points with 4 minutes 45 seconds left. Allen scrambled for his 15 points, 7 fewer than his average. H was 4 of 13 from the field.The outcome kept Duke, the defending champion, from gaining its first back-to-back appearances in the round of 8 in this century.This year’s team hardly seemed a contender. The Blue Devils had a No. 4 seed, their second lowest in nearly two decades, after closing on a 3-4 slide. When an injury short-circuited the standout forward Amile Jefferson’s season after nine games, they shriveled to essentially a six-man rotation, three of them freshmen.With Ingram entering the N.B.A. draft, the reloading begins anew.Oregon has a different goal.“Duke’s a great program, but we wanted to come out and show that we’re confident in ourselves,” Ducks guard Casey Benson said. “To get a win against a program like that is special for our team. It’s another steppingstone to where we want to get to.”A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2016, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline:  Oregon Carries Pac-12 Flag.
