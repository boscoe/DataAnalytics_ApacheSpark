KEEPING SCORE
FEB. 28, 2016
Stephen Curry heard the criticism last week — that his success was due in part to a lack of legitimate perimeter defense in the N.B.A., that today’s stars do not play tough enough to stop him.To put it bluntly, no defense in history could have stopped Curry at the end of the Golden State Warriors’ game at Oklahoma City on Saturday night.The score was tied, 118-118, when Golden State’s Andre Iguodala pulled down a rebound off a missed jumper by the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook with about six seconds remaining in overtime. The Warriors could have called a timeout to set up their offense, but Iguodala instead tossed the ball to Curry, who casually made his way across midcourt. Before the Thunder could put together anything resembling a defense against him, Curry launched the ball toward the hoop from more than 32 feet out.Swish. In addition to beating the rival Thunder, Curry tied the record for the most 3-pointers in a game (12) and broke his own record for most in a season (he has 288 with 24 games to play).Advertisement“What was that, 40 feet?” Golden State’s Draymond Green asked reporters after the game. “That’s absurd.”
            Steph Curry is just ridiculous... pic.twitter.com/sb2h4ToTQT (via @warriors)        To put the shot into perspective, consider that the 3-point arc is approximately 23 feet 9 inches from the basket. By launching the ball so quickly, Curry took the shot well before Andre Roberson, a stout defender for the Thunder, could get back to defend him.AdvertisementCurry finished with 46 points and in his last four games has averaged 43.8 points a game while shooting 61.1 percent from 3-point range, a rate that was actually better than the 60.8 percent he had shot from the field over all.For the season, Curry is leading the N.B.A. in scoring at 30.7 points a game, and he appears to be a lock to be the eighth player in N.B.A. history to complete a so-called 50-40-90 season — shooting 50 percent or better from the field, 40 percent or better from 3-point range and 90 percent or better from the free-throw line.The best in the N.B.A. have given Curry, the N.B.A.’s reigning most valuable player, his due:
@StephenCurry30 needs to stop it man!! He's ridiculous man! Never before seen someone like him in the history of ball!        
            Curry is UNREAL!!!!        With all the praise has come the expected criticism. Some veterans of previous eras have jabbed at Curry in an apparent attempt to justify how the game was superior when they played.Oscar Robertson, a Hall of Famer best known for averaging a triple-double for the Cincinnati Royals in the 1961-62 season, seems intent on writing off Curry’s success as a product of bad defense rather than superior marksmanship.“When I played years ago, if you shot a shot outside and hit it, the next time I’m going to be up on top of you,” Robertson said on “Mike & Mike,” an ESPN radio show, on Thursday. “I’m going to pressure you with three-quarters, half-court defense. But now they don’t do that. These coaches do not understand the game of basketball, as far as I’m concerned.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We have to appreciate what Steph is doing under the rules he’s playing under, and he’s the best player under the circumstances.”While Coach Steve Kerr has been vocal in defending Curry, poking fun at the former stars who have chosen to criticize him, perhaps the best defense came from Andrew Bogut, Golden State’s lumbering center, who mocked the old-timers on Twitter.
            My under 14 team in Melbourne Australia would have beat these @warriors 109-99. Fat Jimmy would have locked down @StephenCurry30 !!!!        Still, for Curry, who has called the criticism “annoying,” the best response was to take a shot that was indefensible both in the sense that no one should have taken it and in the sense that no one could have stopped it.When the shot went in, Curry smiled and danced, just like Cam Newton, the star quarterback of Curry’s beloved Carolina Panthers. And like Newton, he did not seem to care if the old-timers found the whole thing off-putting.A version of this article appears in print on February 29, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Curry’s Heave Silences the Thunder and Mutes His Critics.
