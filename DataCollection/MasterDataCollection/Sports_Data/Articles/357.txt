FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. —  Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield was in his hotel room with some of his Oklahoma teammates when, suddenly, things got serious.The video game finished loading.It was time to play Halo.“He rushes to the front of the bed,” said linebacker Eric Striker, who was among those hanging out with Mayfield during some down time leading up to the Orange Bowl. “We were like, ‘Bake, what’s going on?’ He’s like, ‘The game’s about to start!’ Bake is real intense.”Mayfield is hardly alone in his love for video games.Many college athletes spend their spare time with video games, playing everything from Halo — the science-fiction game preferred by Mayfield — to the always popular Madden NFL.On the surface, it is just today’s version of athletes sitting around playing cards, an obvious conduit for bonding with teammates and satisfying that competitive drive away from the field.But for some, it is more than just fun and games.Clemson running back Wayne Gallman, whose team defeated the Sooners, 37-17, in the Orange Bowl national semifinal Thursday, is convinced that video games has helped improve his performance on the field.Advertisement“When I’m playing Madden, I can see where the blitz is coming from if I’m running the ball,” he said. “I can see where the hole is going to be because you have a bigger view of the field.”AdvertisementAnother of Clemson’s avid gamers, defensive tackle Carlos Watkins, said video games helped him hone skills that can be useful on the field. In particular, he pointed to the hand-eye coordination needed to maneuver a controller while looking at a video screen, which is not entirely different from using his hands to beat a blocker while keeping an eye on the guy with the ball.“You just get so adjusted to it, it’s crazy,” he said.Long viewed as nothing more than a mindless pursuit, video games have become increasingly complex and lifelike — so much so that there are actually colleges offering scholarships to play the games, a de facto league known as Major League Gaming and a growing number of networks willing to televise competitions like League of Legends.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I wouldn’t say the guys on there are athletes. But they’re good at what they do. Obviously, they’re very talented.”Mayfield is pretty talented, too. He has gone so far as to say he does not think anyone on the Oklahoma campus can beat him in Halo.

Alabama receiver ArDarius Stewart is amazed at how far video games have come just since he was a child.Advertisement“It’s just funny looking at it now, like, Aw, man, this is real,” Stewart said. “Now I see it. Now I’m putting it together.”Then again, there are limitations.Mayfield plays down any crossover from the video screen to the real game. But he acknowledged that the complexities of Halo can enhance the decision-making skills needed when he is dissecting defenses, calling an audible and making sure all his teammates are lined up in the right spots.“It’s a good multitasking hobby,” he said. “You’re thinking about one thing and doing another.”Gallman is already looking forward to the next generation of games.“Soon, we’ll just play video games with our bodies,” he said. “I love it.”A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2016, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: When Video Games Are More Than Fun.
