President Obama is expected to attend the game at Estadio Latinoamericano, according to an official involved in its planning, which coincides with Mr. Obama’s visit to the island this month.The Rays will be the first big league team to travel to Cuba since the Baltimore Orioles played the Cuban national team in the spring of 1999. ESPN will televise the game, and its flagship show, “SportsCenter,” will also be broadcast from Havana.The announcement comes after months of negotiating with the Cuban government and its baseball federation, and it represents the latest example of baseball’s role in the easing of tensions between Cuba and the United States. In December, the league and the union, along with stars like Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers, made a good-will visit to the island that included three days of clinics for young ballplayers. The Cuban government also allowed several defectors, including Yasiel Puig and Jose Abreu, to take part in the tour.Advertisement
