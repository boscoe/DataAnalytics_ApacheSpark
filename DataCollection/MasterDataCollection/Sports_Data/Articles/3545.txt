To hear some tell it, the Patriots’ bid for a Super Bowl title was just derailed by the injury to their totemic tight end, Rob Gronkowski.Gronkowski has a herniated disc in his lower back and is most likely out for the rest of the season. He was to have surgery on Friday.Gronkowski gets a lot of attention, whether he is catching passes, hosting Nickelodeon shows or going on a cruise. But how big a blow will his absence be, really?At first glance, Gronkowski’s numbers seem as great as ever, maybe even better. Before the injury, he was averaging more than 21 yards per reception, the best in the league and in his career.AdvertisementBut those long catches do not hide the fact that Gronkowski was also being used less. He has been targeted only 38 times this season, fewer than five times a game. That is down from his average of eight or nine targets a game in recent seasons.
                Explore every team's path to the playoffs.            He accounts for 10 percent of the Patriots’ catches this season, 18 percent of their receiving yards and 14 percent of their receiving touchdowns. All those figures are down significantly from the last two seasons, when they were 20, 26 and 33 percent.AdvertisementAnd the Patriots still have one strong tight end, Martellus Bennett, who has actually been a bigger part of the offense than Gronkowski this year. They are not deep beyond Bennett, however, and will have to stop using so many two-tight-end formations.“It doesn’t help losing great players,” quarterback Tom Brady said on Westwood One radio. “And to not have Gronk out there — one of our best players and most dependable, consistent players — not in the lineup makes things challenging for us. But that’s what the N.F.L. season is about — it’s about overcoming challenges.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It would be laughable to suggest that his loss is not a blow to New England. But the Patriots (9-2) are still a serious title contender, and it helps that there is no obvious threat to them in the A.F.C.The Raiders also are 9-2 but have yet to convince most experts that they are for real. The Chiefs (8-3) are winning ugly. The traditionally strong Steelers (6-5) may not even make the playoffs, and last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Broncos, are still finding their equilibrium with their new quarterback, Trevor Siemian.The Patriots evoke strong feelings among N.F.L. fans, and for fans and critics, it is hard to evaluate a big blow like the loss of Gronkowski dispassionately. But oddsmakers tend to see though partisanship and focus on the bottom line, and they have not flinched. The Patriots remain the comfortable favorites to win the Super Bowl with every bookmaker out there.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
