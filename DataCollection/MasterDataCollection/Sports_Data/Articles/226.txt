ST. LOUIS —  Enos Stanley Kroenke, a native of Missouri and the owner of the Rams, is named after two of this city’s most revered baseball figures, the hustling outfielder Enos Slaughter and the gentlemanly hitter Stan Musial.Mr. Kroenke, 68, was once a local hero, too. He helped lure the Rams, a National Football League franchise, from Los Angeles in 1995 and was a minority owner of the team when it won the Super Bowl in 2000.But now that the Rams are returning to the West Coast, Mr. Kroenke has assumed the cartoon villainy of many a franchise owner who has broken a city’s heart by relocating a team.“We can’t stand him,” Norris Daniels, 27, an airport worker, said Wednesday. “It’s Trump, then him.”This enmity stems not merely from the Rams’ departure, but also from the manner in which they are leaving — after a poison-pen Dear John letter by Mr. Kroenke, who suggested that St. Louis was an economic abyss ill suited to hosting an N.F.L. team.AdvertisementFor many in this devoted sports town, it was the equivalent of a husband declaring publicly not only that he wants to leave his wife for another woman but that his wife deserves to spend the rest of her life alone.AdvertisementMr. Kroenke’s actions are evoking a sense of abandonment similar to that felt in Brooklyn when Walter O’Malley moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles after the 1957 season, in Baltimore when Robert Irsay spirited the Colts to Indianapolis under cover of darkness in 1984, and in Cleveland when Art Modell took the Browns to Baltimore before the 1996 season. Except, in this case, Mr. Kroenke seems to have twisted the knife an extra half-turn or so.Chane Keller, 26, a real estate developer and a Rams season-ticket holder, said that widespread dislike for Mr. Kroenke might accomplish something once considered unthinkable here: restoring the popularity of Bill Bidwill, who moved the football Cardinals from St. Louis to Phoenix after the 1987 season.“It’s disappointing” to see the Rams go, Mr. Keller said, “but good riddance to Kroenke. He was cruel. You don’t kick a person when they’re down.”In lobbying his fellow N.F.L. owners to let him move his franchise, Mr. Kroenke suggested that it was not economically feasible for St. Louis to sustain the Rams along with baseball’s Cardinals and hockey’s Blues. His position, first reported by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was criticized here as being gratuitous and exaggerated, but nevertheless, it was considered devastating.Compared with “all other U.S. cities, St. Louis is struggling,” Mr. Kroenke contended in his application to move the Rams, adding that the city “lags, and will continue to lag, far behind in the economic drivers that are necessary for sustained success of an N.F.L. franchise.”Mr. Kroenke complained about sagging attendance and the condition of the domed stadium where his team played. And he dismissed St. Louis’s plan to build a $1.1 billion open-air stadium, saying, “Any N.F.L. club that signs on to this proposal in St. Louis will be well on the road to financial ruin, and the league will be harmed.”Long known as Silent Stanley for his circumspect style in buying professional teams in football, basketball, hockey and soccer, Mr. Kroenke has become one of professional sports’ richest owners, with an estimated worth of $7.5 billion, built on a foundation of real estate and marriage into the Walmart fortune.AdvertisementHe now has an N.F.L. team headed for greener financial pastures in the nation’s second-largest television market and an English soccer team, Arsenal, that sits atop the Premier League.In a statement, Mr. Kroenke described the decision to move to Los Angeles as “bittersweet” and called the citizens of St. Louis “incredibly hard-working, passionate and proud people.”He said that he had negotiated with local officials in good faith and that the move was not “about whether I love St. Louis or Missouri.”“I do and always will,” he said. “No matter what anyone says, that will never change. This decision is about what is in the best long-term interests of the Rams organization and the National Football League.”And therein exists the eternal tension between fans, who view a franchise’s viability in terms of loyalty, and team owners, who are business people more concerned with the bottom line.It might be argued that St. Louis is merely receiving karmic payback for poaching the Rams from Los Angeles two decades ago. In 1995, St. Louis was giddy, its chest puffed by the arrival of an N.F.L. team to replace the departed Cardinals. Mr. Kroenke was considered a civic treasure. Now, things are different.Headlines above a front-page column in Wednesday’s Post-Dispatch said, “Feckless Thugs of N.F.L. Leave Us With Just Memories” and “Black-Hearted Goodell Fronts a Cash-Driven Cartel,” a reference to N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell.

In the column, Benjamin Hochman wrote that it was an “insult” for Mr. Kroenke to be named for Mr. Musial, who would be forever remembered “as what was best of St. Louis sports.”Advertisement“Stan Kroenke will forever be remembered for what was worst: moving the team so the billionaire could make more billions,” Mr. Hochman wrote.Not only has St. Louis now twice lost an N.F.L. team, but more than $100 million in bond debt is still owed on the suddenly vacated Edward Jones Dome, where the Rams played, according to news accounts.There may be some advantages to not having an N.F.L. team. Fans will no longer be forced to watch a franchise that has not had a winning season since 2003 and can instead view the best N.F.L. games available each week on television.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Rob Schaaf, a Missouri state senator, led political opposition to the extension of state bonds to help pay for a new stadium. Last January, he told reporters, “The state of Missouri is not designed to support N.F.L. teams.”On Wednesday, though, a clinical dissection of the Rams’ departure often gave way to emotion, to criticism of Mr. Kroenke’s perceived lack of community involvement and what many considered his harsh assessment of St. Louis, which in recent years has battled a reputation for high crime and racial inequality.“St. Louis has been through a lot,” said Breanne Weaver, 27, a hair stylist. “Forget about Ferguson. St. Louis is listed with all these terrible statistics. People know that. For him to basically say now that we don’t have a shot at anything, that we’re just going to fall into the Mississippi, it’s sad.”And while the Cardinals are perhaps the best-operated team in baseball, the departure of the Rams still delivered a gut punch to St. Louis’s civic image as a major league city.“They were a big part of our lives,” said Mike Burris, 30, a cashier. “It’s like we’re losing family.”A version of this article appears in print on January 14, 2016, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Move Puts Space Between Owner and Hometown.
