Michel Platini said Thursday that he was ending his bid to become FIFA president, dropping out of a race that technically did not include him and one that he is officially barred from winning.In a series of interviews, Mr. Platini said he would continue his fight to overturn his eight-year suspension from world soccer, imposed last month by FIFA’s ethics committee. But he said pursuing that cause and the presidency before the Feb. 27 FIFA election was unworkable.

And even if he succeeds in having his suspension overturned, it is unclear if Mr. Platini can pass the new integrity checks required by FIFA to enter the race. On Thursday, he acknowledged that even if he was successful, he would not have enough time to campaign for the support he would need to win.Mr. Platini’s announcement and CAS’s recent rejection of appeals by two other disqualified candidates mean the field of approved challengers bidding to replace Mr. Blatter remains at five. They are: Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, who lost a challenge to Mr. Blatter at the FIFA congress last May; Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, the powerful Asian Football Confederation president; the South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale; Jérôme Champagne, a former aide to Mr. Blatter; and the longtime European soccer official Gianni Infantino.A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Soccer; Platini Ends Bid to Lead FIFA.
