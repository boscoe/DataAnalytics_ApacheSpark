There are six weeks remaining in the N.F.L. season, and more than 90 games to come. Some will be crucial, and some will be 60 minutes of garbage time. But which are which?Thanks to The Upshot’s Playoff Simulator at nytimes.com, The New York Times can quantify that.Every game counts in the standings, but some are much more likely to affect the playoffs than others. A game like the Jets at the Patriots on Christmas Eve does not look too important: The Patriots are a lock to make the postseason, and the Jets are a huge long shot. The Browns at the Steelers on Jan. 1 might turn out to matter a lot to Pittsburgh, but it will not affect Cleveland’s playoff chances, which are zero.But a handful of games are likely to be crucial for the playoff hopes of both teams. These are the biggest games left this year, according to The Upshot’s simulator.10. Saints at Falcons, Jan. 1The Falcons have a one-game lead in the N.F.C. South, and are in solid playoff shape. The Saints are 4-6 and are fighting to stay alive. But a twist or two during the next few weeks could make this season-ending game mean everything.Advertisement9. Broncos at Chiefs, Dec. 25The Raiders, the Chiefs and the Broncos are in a dogfight for the A.F.C. West, as well as wild-card consolation prizes. Of all the games left on their schedules, this ranks as the most important, although the Chiefs at the Broncos on Dec. 4 is 11th on the list.
                Explore every team's path to the playoffs.            8. Giants at Eagles, Dec. 22The scramble for wild cards behind the Cowboys will create three of the most interesting games. The Eagles are in the worst shape at 5-5 and really need to reverse the Giants’ 28-23 victory from earlier this month. The game is a potential rarity: An important game on this season’s Thursday night schedule.Advertisement7. Dolphins at Bills, Dec. 24Another wild-card battle since the Patriots are close to wrapping up the A.F.C. East. The Upshot currently gives the Bills a 15 percent chance of making the playoffs and ending a 16-year playoff drought, the longest in the league. A win against the Dolphins, who are a game ahead of the Bills, would double that chance.6. Lions at Giants, Dec. 18The most important nondivisional matchup left this year. The winner will be in the driver’s seat for a wild card, and the loser might be out.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Redskins at Eagles, Dec. 11; Giants at Redskins, Jan. 1As it stands, the Cowboys, sitting at 9-1, are the likely N.F.C. East champions. But their three division rivals — the Giants (7-3), the Redskins (6-3-1) and the Eagles (5-5) — are all in the mix for at least one, and maybe both, wild-card spots. The three games among the teams will go a long way to determining who gets in.3. Texans at Colts, Dec. 11The Texans are a game up in the A.F.C. South, while the Colts, who have made the playoffs 12 of the past 14 seasons, are in trouble. This is a must-win home game for Indianapolis.2. Vikings at Lions, ThursdayA big game on Thanksgiving afternoon. At the moment, the teams are tied for first in the N.F.C. North, at 6-4. Whichever team wins will have a huge leg up on the other. How important could a game in Week 12 really be? A win for the Vikings gives them an 84 percent chance of reaching the playoffs; a loss drops their chances to 44 percent. The Lions’ figures are similar: 73 percent with a win, and 32 percent with a loss.1. Ravens at Steelers, Dec. 25The most important game this season will be played on Christmas, The Upshot model currently finds. These teams are tied for the lead in the A.F.C. North at 5-5. Each has six games to play, but this is the big one. No other game for either team is in the top 10. Wild-card berths are unlikely for them, so it is a division title or bust. The winner will have about a 70 percent chance at the playoffs; the loser about 20 percent.Any top-10 list automatically raises the question: What is at the bottom of the pile? If you have a ticket to the 49ers at the Bears on Dec. 4, do not expect a vital game. San Francisco (1-9) and Chicago (2-8) are well out of the playoff chase, and the game does not affect any other teams’ chances.AdvertisementThe Upshot ranks it as the game with the absolute least relevance to the playoff chase.
