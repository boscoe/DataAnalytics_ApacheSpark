Antti Raanta stood alone in his crease as his Rangers teammates huddled at the bench during a timeout less than five minutes into Sunday’s game at Madison Square Garden. By that point, the Islanders had already raced to a stunning 3-0 lead.With Henrik Lundqvist missing a second straight game, Raanta had spoken after the morning skate about not overthinking his temporary status as the Rangers’ starting goaltender.But after the Islanders’ early home-crowd-hushing barrage, Raanta had to be trying hard to cleanse his mind of just about everything.“First period was the weirdest hockey period in my hockey life,” Raanta said later. “It felt like it was the coldest nightmare.”AdvertisementRaanta did manage to steady himself, and the Rangers fought back to knot the score at 4-4 on a power-play goal by Derick Brassard 11 minutes 39 seconds into the third period.AdvertisementBut the Islanders’ Cal Clutterbuck took a pass from Casey Cizikas off a face-off and rifled home a goal with 1:28 to play, and Frans Nielsen added an empty-net goal 27 seconds later, icing a 6-4 win that left the Islanders (36-20-7) 3 points behind the Rangers (38-22-6) for second in the Metropolitan Division. The Islanders, who have won three straight against the Rangers this season, also have three games in hand.“In a game like that, you can’t really question the events that led up to the winning goal,” said Clutterbuck, a gritty right wing, whose goal was his third winner this season. “I caught it and flung it on net.”Islanders defenseman Johnny Boychuk opened the scoring 2:50 into the game, with Brock Nelson scoring at 3:35 and then Kyle Okposo at 4:45. The Rangers did not even record a shot on goal until more than 10 minutes had elapsedBut the game soon became equally precarious for Raanta’s Islanders counterpart, Jaroslav Halak.At 11:16 of the first period, Oscar Lindberg poked in his first goal since Jan. 9, and the fourth-line left wing Tanner Glass tapped in a rebound at 11:54 to cut the Rangers’ deficit to 3-2 and rouse the sleepy Garden crowd.“We kind of came out a little flat, and they capitalized on some bounces,” said Rangers center Derek Stepan, who lost the face-off against Cizikas that led to Clutterbuck’s winner. “Then we kind of did the same thing to them in the second half of the first period. I think we responded really well after being down, 3-0.”As the fans were trying to process the offensive frenzy, Boychuk scored again at 13:14 on a long shot from the right point — the first time in his career he had scored twice in a game.Raanta — perhaps wondering if he might be pulled in favor of the rookie Magnus Hellberg, recalled from Hartford — again hunched up as the Islanders celebrated.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The scoring finally ceased, however, and the period concluded with the Islanders leading, 4-3.Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said he was happy with his team’s strong play early in the first period.“They didn’t have a sniff,” he said of the Rangers.The fast start helped the Islanders survive a scoreless second period in which the Rangers held an 11-7 shooting advantage and a third period featuring tight defense and steady goaltending.The victory was the Islanders’ sixth from a season-high seven-game trip, giving them momentum ahead of a home game Tuesday against the Pittsburgh Penguins, who downed the Devils, 6-1, to remain 3 points behind the Islanders in the division race.Raanta had won his previous three starts for the Rangers but was facing the Islanders for the first time in his career. Heading into the game, he seemed only to want to keep a level head.“I’ve been working hard in practice when I haven’t been playing,” Raanta, acquired from Chicago in June to back up Lundqvist, said after the morning skate. “Now it’s time for those things to pay off a little bit, and be ready for some games in a row.”Raanta, 26, got the opportunity because Lundqvist, who collided with his teammate Ryan McDonagh during Thursday’s loss at Pittsburgh, remained out with what Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault described as continuing neck spasms.“His movements aren’t fully fluid,” Vigneault said of Lundqvist, who skated on Sunday morning before the team skate and was listed as day-to-day.The Islanders might have preferred facing Raanta, but Capuano, with prescience, said before the game, “It’s always a track meet playing these guys.”AdvertisementCapuano added, “We have to just work and play a simple game.”It did not quite work out that way, but the 2 points the Islanders picked up could prove key as the postseason looms, and with it another possible clash between the New York teams.A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2016, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Islanders Withstand Rally by Rangers and Gain Ground in the Playoff Race.
