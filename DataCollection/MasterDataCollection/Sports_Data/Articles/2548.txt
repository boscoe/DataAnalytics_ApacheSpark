United States lawmakers wrote to the International Olympic Committee this week, urging officials to seize “crucial and timely opportunities” to combat doping and clean up global sports ahead of the Rio de Janeiro Games next month.In a letter sent Tuesday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over international sports, expressed concerns about allegations of systematic doping in Russia and, more broadly, conflicts of interest within the global antidoping effort.The three-page letter, which did not make specific requests, expressed support for certain recent actions taken by the I.O.C. and the World Anti-Doping Agency.
                The House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter Tuesday to the I.O.C. expressing concern about doping in international sports.            The committee applauded WADA for having initiated an investigation into accusations of cheating by Russia at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and the I.O.C. for having announced plans to re-examine the structure of the antidoping system. Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., to whom Tuesday’s letter was addressed, said last month that he wanted to make WADA more independent, and he announced a summit on the topic on Oct. 8. WADA is funded by sports organizations and national governments, including the United States.AdvertisementIn the letter, the committee said, “These efforts appear to signal the beginning of a serious commitment to ensure clean sport and allay some of the concerns expressed by this committee as well as others.”AdvertisementLast month, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation expressed similar concerns, posing several questions to WADA to which the agency responded last week, saying it had “no clear authority” to immediately undertake investigations of whistle-blowers’ claims about Russian doping.The results of the independent Sochi investigation commissioned by WADA are expected Monday. If the accusations of cheating made by a former longtime director of Russia’s antidoping lab are proven true, WADA has indicated it may recommend barring Russia entirely from Rio.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
