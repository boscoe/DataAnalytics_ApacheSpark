TORONTO — Step into Scott Moore’s downtown office and your eyes will be drawn to a bank of 12 monitors and a larger, flat-screen TV perched above his desk.Moore, the president of Sportsnet and N.H.L. Properties, likes to keep watch over how his company’s $5.2 billion league investment is performing.Not so long ago it was an eyesore.Last year, all seven Canadian teams missed the N.H.L. playoffs. It was the first time since 1970 that Canada was shut out of the postseason. The country’s hockey fans went into shock, and TV ratings plunged for the parent company of Sportsnet, Rogers Media, which has the broadcasting rights for the N.H.L. in Canada.Asked how it felt to have no Canadian teams in the postseason, Moore said, “Ask NBC how they would feel about an Edmonton-Montreal Stanley Cup final.”AdvertisementBut this season, five Canadian teams are among the 16 teams in the N.H.L. playoffs, which will begin on Wednesday.AdvertisementAnd Moore has pronounced himself among the happiest people in Canada this spring.“I’m certainly in the top five,” he said with a laugh, putting himself in the same company as the president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brendan Shanahan, whose team qualified for the postseason for only the second time since 2004 and for the first time in four years.Joining the Leafs in the playoffs are the Montreal Canadiens, the Ottawa Senators, the Edmonton Oilers and the Calgary Flames.Having the Leafs and the Canadiens in the postseason is particularly beneficial for Rogers.“This is a renaissance of passion for hockey in the biggest markets in the country, and that has huge trickle-down effects,” Moore said. “It helps the entire brand.”Because of the Canadian surge, Moore’s TV network will see viewership jump and advertising dollars pour in after a ratings free fall last spring resulted in revenue losses and cost people their jobs.In the East, the Canadiens will play the Rangers, the Leafs will face the Washington Capitals and the Senators will meet the Boston Bruins.The Oilers will play the defending Western Conference champions, the San Jose Sharks, while the Flames are going against the Anaheim Ducks.An Anaheim victory on Sunday night in the final game of the regular season prevented a first-round battle of Alberta between Edmonton and Calgary. The Leafs’ loss to Columbus on Sunday night meant there would be no battle of Ontario between Toronto and Ottawa.AdvertisementThe Leafs needed a 5-3 victory on Saturday against the Pittsburgh Penguins to squeak into the postseason.The city of Toronto was gripped with nervous tension all week as the Leafs stumbled in previous attempts to clinch a playoff spot.Nerves were further frayed when goaltender Frederik Andersen left the game on Saturday when he took a knee to the head, but he is expected to be back for Game 1 of the playoffs.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He grew up in Scottsdale, Ariz., and was drawn to hockey by watching the Coyotes, a franchise that was part of the growth of the sport in warm-weather markets spurred by Gretzky.The stakes have been high since 2013, when Rogers made a big gamble on the N.H.L. with a 12-year, $5.2 billion package that was the biggest media rights agreement in league history.Five Canadian clubs made the postseason in 2014-15. Then came the all-Canadian wipeout.“I’d be willing to stake my reputation on it that it will never happen again,” Moore said.His job may depend on it.Last April, Gord Cutler, the man in charge of hockey production at Sportsnet and “Hockey Night in Canada,” was fired. And in June, Sportsnet ended its two-year experiment of using George Stroumboulopoulos, 44, as a host to attract a younger audience.Stroumboulopoulos, a former music V.J. and talk-show host, was let go, and Ron MacLean, 56, who had been an institution on “Hockey Night in Canada” since 1986, was reinstated as host.AdvertisementAt the time, senior management and board members at Rogers told Moore: “We’re two years into a 12-year deal, and this doesn’t look very good.”Moore said to trust him that things would turn around.No Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup since the Canadiens in 1993, but Moore said the country should brace for a seismic event.“There’s going to be a year where Edmonton is playing Montreal in the Stanley Cup final,” he said, “and someone will think I’m a genius.”A version of this article appears in print on April 11, 2017, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Resurgent Canadian Teams Buoy Broadcaster.
