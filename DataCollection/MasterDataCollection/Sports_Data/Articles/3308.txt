The ball was behind me, and I tried to hit it with a back-heel.”With Mesut Ozil ill in bed, Wenger had little choice but to start Giroud for the second straight game.Giroud had also played a role in the sweeping counterattack that started inside Arsenal’s half and ended with the opening goal.“Olivier transformed that goal into art,” Wenger said. “Art because of the surprise, because the beauty of the movement and because the efficiency of the movement — the ball went in.”TOTTENHAM RISES WITH WIN Harry Kane and Dele Alli each scored twice as Tottenham climbed to fourth in the Premier League with a 4-1 victory at Watford.Tottenham took full advantage of Manchester City’s loss at Liverpool on Saturday, as City slid from third to fifth over the New Year’s holiday weekend.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
