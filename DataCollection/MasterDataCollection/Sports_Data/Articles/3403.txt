PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. —  In the fall of 2013, after the Mets selected Dominic Smith out of high school with the 11th overall pick in the first round and gave him a $2.6 million contract, one of his first big purchases was a new six-bedroom, five-bathroom home in a gated community here. It was about 10 minutes from the Mets’ spring training facility, and it was big enough that his mother, two siblings and a young nephew could live with him. Smith was only 18, after all.“Am I grown now?” he asked his mother when they moved in.Not yet, she replied.When Smith played in Savannah, Ga., in 2014, in his first full season in the minors, his mother and sister lived with him in a two-bedroom apartment there and traveled to many of his road games. When Smith played for the St. Lucie Mets in 2015, his family went to the games, forming their own cheering section. His mother still did his laundry, and his sister cooked, and he spent some of his free time attending his nephew’s Little League games.This is the support system Smith has had in place since he was drafted. And as the Mets became contenders and promoted or traded their top prospects, Smith, a left-handed first baseman, has perhaps become the top prospect in the organization.He is set to start the season with the Mets’ Class AA affiliate in Binghamton, N.Y., but, the Mets said, if an injury were to occur, he could possibly make his major league debut later this year. More likely, he will emerge at the major league level in the 2017 season, which just happens to be the final one before Lucas Duda, the Mets’ incumbent first baseman, reaches free agency.AdvertisementIs Smith in line to replace Duda? It certainly seems possible, and in a sign of Smith’s progress, the Mets invited him to the major league camp this spring to give him a glimpse of what it is like to be at the top level and to evaluate him more closely.The Mets know all about his smooth swing and capable glove work, which bode well for the future. On the other hand, they also saw that he showed up in camp this month looking a little heavy. They also know he has yet to display the home run power that was projected for him when he was taken with such a high pick. But that, the Mets believe, will come.AdvertisementFor now, they are satisfied with his steady climb through the minors, which, in turn, would seem to fit with his family’s move away from the South Central area of Los Angeles once Smith was picked by the Mets.“It was important to take him out of South Central so he could stay focused, stay grounded, stay humble,” said his mother, Yvette LaFleur. She said she did not need people telling her son “he’s the man and all that, because it may have changed his thinking.”“Maybe he starts thinking that he is the man,” she said. “No, you’re not. You’re not.”LaFleur said she first felt the impulse to move her family as she and her son were heading back to their hotel on the night of the 2013 draft, which was held in New Jersey. When they returned home to Los Angeles, the community’s response was overwhelming. Maybe too overwhelming. LaFleur said she envisioned the years ahead with her son’s newfound fame and thought it would be better if home became a place where he was not as well known.LaFleur had grown up in South Central Los Angeles after her family moved there when she was about 13. When she was in her mid-30s, she had no job and two children and had been addicted to drugs and alcohol for more than 10 years. Her mother took her children away and threatened to keep them if she did not sober up and straighten out her life.It was around then that she learned she was pregnant again. The father was Clabe Smith, whom she had been dating.“I was pretty sure I was going to terminate my pregnancy,” she said. “I just wanted my other two kids back. I couldn’t worry about a third baby.”AdvertisementBut she changed her mind, and that child turned out to be Dominic.And all those years later, her children are with her, and Clabe Smith has stayed a friend and a father to Dominic, although he remains in California. And she said her son did not put up a fight when she decided to move the family to the other side of the country.For one thing, most of Smith’s good friends, the ones with whom he had grown up playing baseball with at one of Major League Baseball’s urban youth academies (at the time he was picked, Smith was the highest-drafted player to come from the program) had also been drafted by major league teams or were playing college baseball. He also had nowhere in Los Angeles that he thought he could train like a professional athlete. He could in Port St. Lucie.Coming from Los Angeles, Smith has understandably found Port St. Lucie to be more subdued. He took over the house’s master bedroom and outfitted it with a 60-inch television. Out back, he installed a Ping-Pong table. Still, he got bored enough this past winter to dye his hair caramel blond, giving himself a bit of an Odell Beckham Jr. look.“We try to keep things as normal as possible for him,” LaFleur said of her son. “On a Friday night, he’ll be home playing Trouble or Monopoly or a card game with his siblings. I’m not saying it will always be like this; he’ll be 21 in June. But for now, he’s still a homebody.”Living here has allowed Smith to continually train at the Mets’ complex, to take batting practice and field grounders year round. For three winters now, the Mets have had Smith attend an off-season program with Mike Barwis, the director of their strength and conditioning program, who has a training facility at the Mets’ complex.The Mets have invited only certain players to train with Barwis, another indication of how highly the team regards Smith. His manager for the past two years, Luis Rojas, said that Smith was such a natural defender that he had the potential to be a Gold Glove winner. Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson compared Smith’s plate discipline to that of Michael Conforto, who had a standout rookie season with the Mets in 2015. The Mets figure Smith will mature physically, and someday hit about 20 home runs a year.“If he continues to hit the way he has,” Alderson said, “he could accelerate pretty quickly.”As for his weight — he reported to camp around 230 pounds — Smith knows he needs to change his eating habits. Rojas has already spoken with him about taking better care of his body; his sister is now making more vegetables, and fewer starches, for meals at home.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Corner infielders are expected to hit for power, and in Smith’s first full minor league season, at Class A Savannah, he hit only one home run in 518 plate appearances. That off-season, Smith tinkered with his swing, trying to make it more of a power stroke, and it threw him off. The following season, at St. Lucie, which is the highest level of Class A ball in the Mets’ system, he batted .157 and had just one extra-base hit during the first 19 games.As Smith tried to correct himself, every week or so he would chat with Drew Toussaint, the scout who signed him and knew his swing. They had first met when Smith was 12 and Toussaint was still playing in the minor leagues and working at the youth academy during the off-season.

Very easy. Very simple. He was just naturally born to hit.”Now, Toussaint had to remind him what the Mets were trying to tell him: The power will come; just focus on developing as a hitter and learning the strike zone.Once Smith simplified his swing and returned to his natural mechanics, he batted .332 the rest of the season at St. Lucie. One of the youngest players on the team, he led the Florida State League with 33 doubles and finished fourth in slugging percentage, at .417. Then he batted .385 in the prospect-rich Arizona Fall League, although he played in only 12 games before being injured.Between the two leagues, Smith had 548 plate appearances last year but only hit seven home runs. Alderson came to his defense, noting that the parks he has played in the past two years were tough on developing power hitters. Neither the Mets nor Smith seem concerned — for now.“It’s the last tool to come, everybody says,” Smith said.Starting in high school and especially after he was drafted, Smith began filling his right arm with tattoos. On his upper arm, he now has a picture of Jesus showing a young boy how to swing a bat. On his forearm, he has the words “Your Dream” and, subtly, in the background, the outline of the state of California.This off-season, he acquired a new tattoo that seems to speak to his situation.“I don’t know the key to success,” it reads, “but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.”A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2016, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Ensconced in Family, Top Prospect Tries to Grow Into a Man, and a Met .
