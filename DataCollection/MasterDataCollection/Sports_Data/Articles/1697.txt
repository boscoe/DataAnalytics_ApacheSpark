Eight years after they won medals in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Beijing, four members of the United States team are working for NBC Sports.The best-known of the four, the former all-around gold medalist Nastia Liukin, has replaced Elfi Schlegel as NBC’s lead gymnastics analyst, joining the veteran Tim Daggett. Samantha Peszek is contributing commentary to “The Daily Dismount,” a digital program. Jonathan Horton is the analyst on NBC’s live streaming of gymnastics and is also on “The Daily Dismount,” which is produced in Stamford, Conn., at NBC Sports’s headquarters. And Bridget Sloan is a production assistant in graphics in the digital newsroom.It is commonplace for former Olympians to become analysts at NBC. The network’s roster includes Cynthia Potter (diving), Mary Whipple (rowing), Ato Boldon (track and field), Julie Swail Ertel (water polo and triathlon), Rowdy Gaines (swimming) and Shane Hamman (weight lifting). But a cluster of so many athletes from a single sport’s Olympic team is a coincidence.“It’s not like, ‘Oh, they were all so good at interviews in 2008 we had to hire them,’” said Rebecca Chatman, the coordinating producer for NBC’s Olympic unit. “We look at people we think would be good and engaging and have a desire to do it.”Sloan holds the most junior position, a behind-the-scenes role that she hopes will led to future onscreen work.Advertisement“I have my eye on the SEC Network,” she said Tuesday in Stamford during a break in her schedule. Sloan won a silver medal in the team competition in Beijing, but an injured elbow kept her from making the 2012 Olympic squad. She went to the University of Florida — where she won six individual N.C.A.A. titles — and found it to be a more relaxing experience than the Olympics. Years later, she said that she wished she had been less serious in Beijing.Advertisement“In college, I could cut loose, the routines were a bit easier and it helped me fall in love with the sport again,” she said.Peszek, another silver medalist from Beijing, is a gymnastics analyst at the Pac-12 Network but wanted to return to work at the Olympics.“At first they said they didn’t have a place for me, but then called back,” said Peszek, who won three N.C.A.A. championships for U.C.L.A. She said that she had been texting the other day with Shawn Johnson, yet another member of the 2008 team working in a media role in Rio, for Yahoo. They were fretting about the current United States team, which was widely expected to win the team gold.

We know how hard it can be.”Said Sloan: “When I was watching the Olympic trials, I was so happy I wasn’t competing with them. No way I would stand a chance against them.”Liukin did some on-air work for NBC at the 2012 and 2014 Olympics, but taking over for Schlegel puts her at the center of a sport that is part of the network’s prime-time foundation, along with swimming, diving, track and field, and beach volleyball.Liukin, who collected five medals in Beijing, said that NBC’s gymnastics producer, Billy Matthews, gave her the best advice about communicating with viewers.“He said, ‘Talk to Madelyn at home,’ and I said, ‘Who’s Madelyn?’” Liukin said. “He said: ‘Exactly. Have a conversation with people, tell them about gymnastics. You have a passion. Share it. And when you make a statement, back it up.’”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
