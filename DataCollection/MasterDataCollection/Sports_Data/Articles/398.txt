The 19-year-old Rublev’s first-round win here was his first in a major tournament.Murray next faces No. 31 Sam Querrey, who had a 7-6 (5), 6-0, 6-1 win over the 17-year-old wild card Alex De Minaur.Roger Federer’s progress was more straightforward, beating 20-year-old qualifier Noah Rubin, 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 (3), to maintain his record of never failing to reach the third round at the 18 Australian Opens he has contested.After back-to-back wins over qualifiers, the degree of difficulty in the 17-time Grand Slam winner’s comeback from a six-month injury layoff will increase exponentially. Next up, Federer faces the 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych, who had a 6-3, 7-6 (6), 6-2 win over Ryan Harrison.Also looming, potentially, is No. 5 Kei Nishikori, the 2014 U.S. Open finalist, who set up a third-round match against Lukas Lacko with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 win over Jeremy Chardy.They’re all in the same quarter of the draw as Murray.The U.S. Open champion, Stan Wawrinka, advanced by 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 over Steve Johnson and will next play No. 29 Viktor Troicki in the lower quarter of the top half of the draw.No. 19 John Isner, the highest-seeded U.S. player in the men’s draw, lost to Mischa Zverev, 6-7 (4), 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (7), 9-7 and followed Johnson, Rubin and Harrison out. Wins by No. 23 Jack Sock and Querrey ended the day on a more positive note for the American men.No. 7 Marin Cilic and No. 14 Nick Kyrgios were beaten in night matches. Cilic lost in four sets to Daniel Evans, and No. 89-ranked Andreas Seppi rallied from two sets down and saved a match point to beat Kyrgios, 1-6, 6-7 (1), 6-4, 6-2, 10-8, in a seesawing match that featured a high-risk, between-the-legs shot from the enigmatic Australian.Defending champion Angelique Kerber celebrated her 29th birthday with a 6-2, 6-7 (3), 6-2 second-round win over Carina Witthoeft.The crowd sang her “Happy Birthday,” although she wasn’t entirely on song. The No. 1-ranked Kerber angrily swiped her racket in the second set in a burst of frustration that momentarily threw her off her game.She had two double-faults in the tiebreaker, as Witthoeft leveled the match, but regained control in the third.Kerber planned to celebrate over dinner, then get back to work before Friday’s third-round match against Kristyna Pliskova, who beat No. 27 Irina-Camelia Begu 6-4, 7-6 (8). Pliskova’s twin sister, Karolina, lost the U.S. Open final to Kerber.Speaking of age, Venus Williams had to field questions about getting older after an energetic performance in her 6-3, 6-2 win over Stefanie Voegele.The 36-year-old, seven-time major winner played the first of her record 73 Grand Slam tournaments at the French Open in 1997.“It’s an honor and privilege to start that young,” she added, laughing, “and play this old.”Venus and Serena Williams, who have won 14 major doubles titles together, withdrew from a scheduled first-round doubles match later Wednesday, citing an injury to Venus’ right elbow.In her next singles match, Venus will play Duan Yingying, who beat Varvara Lepchenko, 6-1, 3-6, 10-8. In other third-round matches, two-time major winner Svetlana Kuznetsova will meet former No. 1-ranked Jelena Jankovic, No. 11 Elina Svitolina will take on No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and Eugenie Bouchard, who reached the semifinals here and the Wimbledon final in 2014, will play CoCo Vandeweghe.French Open champion Garbine Muguruza beat Samantha Crawford 7-5, 6-4 in a night match, and Mona Barthel beat Olympic gold medalist Monica Puig.Advertisement
