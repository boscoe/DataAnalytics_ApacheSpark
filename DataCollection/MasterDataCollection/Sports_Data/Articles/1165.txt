Brianne Theisen-Eaton could feel the gold slipping away. She just could not explain why.It was almost a year ago, and Theisen-Eaton had just run, jumped and thrown through unexpected stage fright in the heptathlon at the world outdoor track and field championships in Beijing. As a favorite looking to win the first of what she and her husband — the world’s top decathlete, Ashton Eaton — hoped would be double gold medals at worlds, she had cracked on the first day of the two-day competition.“I kept telling myself — and this is the worst thing you can say to yourself when you’re competing — ‘Don’t screw up; don’t screw up; don’t screw up,’” she said. “You just start to back off, and you are not aggressive. And I was terrified the whole time I was out there.”Afterward, she navigated the gantlet of reporters in the Bird’s Nest stadium in a fog.“People were asking, ‘What is going on?’” she said. “And I probably said, ‘I don’t know,’ like over 100 times.”Finally, a reporter asked her, “Do you think you’re just not cut out for this?”“And I looked at him and said again, ‘I don’t know,’” Theisen-Eaton recalled. “And I remember thinking that was probably my lowest point ever, to say that I didn’t believe in myself like that.”AdvertisementHow to learn to trust yourself? How to identify the tricks your own mind is playing on you? How to fight off the doubts about your own abilities that have lurked for too long?AdvertisementThose questions — hardly restricted to elite athletes — weigh especially heavily on Theisen-Eaton who, with her husband, will spend the next week trying to become the first married couple to win gold medals for different countries at the same Olympics.Brianne, 27, is Canadian; Ashton, 28, is American. Over the past year, they and their coach, Harry Marra, invited The New York Times inside their preparations for Rio, offering a rare glimpse at the triumphs, challenges and emotions that accompany the singular quest of two of the world’s best athletes, partners in life and in training, as they try to peak at the same moment to claim a long-running goal separately and together.The Eatons — married since 2013 and teammates since they were winning N.C.A.A. titles at the University of Oregon — are both analytical, driven, social-media savvy and devoted to good coffee and each other’s cause.But they are coming at their dual goal from different angles, and what became clear through the visits is that within their tight circle, this Olympic cycle is more focused on Brianne than Ashton, even if the wider world might expect the opposite to be true. Over several visits with the couple, Ashton sometimes looked more dialed into Brianne’s training than his own, interrupting his pole vault practice to shout advice to Brianne as she worked on her javelin technique.But then Ashton already knows in his marrow that he has what it takes to win an Olympic gold medal. He has one from London in 2012, along with the world record, broken most recently during his victory last year in Beijing. Brianne — never considered a can’t-miss talent — still wonders. And still worries.“I’m more obviously wanting her to accomplish her goals and dreams because I feel like I have,” Ashton said. “I see the time and energy she puts in it, and we’re in a unique situation where we very much understand what it costs a person to try to get that gold medal. So I’m not just some guy who sits in an office and is like, ‘Well, you’re a silver medalist; you’ll get it next time.’ I see it at practice. I see how much harder she has to work, how much less easy it comes for her, and so that’s tough.”At work, Ashton is the natural. A quick study and a rare and exquisite blend of explosive power and feline grace, Ashton has recorded the best long jump and the fastest 400 meters (and the second-fastest 100) in the century-old history of the decathlon. Brianne is the hard-driving, higher-strung overachiever: world-class in no individual event yet committed to squeezing every bit of toothpaste out of the tube.AdvertisementAshton has his playful side and his absent-minded side, but in conversation he pauses frequently and weighs each word, projecting calm and leaning on analogies to illustrate his thoughts. Brianne is more rapid-fire: more openly vulnerable and ambitious and quick to question herself or a method.That sour-and-sweet meet in Beijing — where she settled for the silver medal behind Jessica Ennis-Hill of Britain and Ashton wearily celebrated gold — left her with even more questions.“When Bri woke up the second day of her competition, we met outside the hotel for a 5 a.m. shakeout,” Marra said. “And she was in tears, and she says: ‘What if I go out there today and stink the joint up? I’ll embarrass myself.’ And I said, ‘Brianne, you want to be Olympic champion next year?’“And she said, ‘Yeah, I do.’ And I said: ‘Well, it starts right here. You have to show the people that you stunk the joint up but you can come back and fight.’’’It is the week before Thanksgiving, and the Eatons are back at their modest home base in Eugene, the green and often damp college town where they met and fell in love.They are back in the company of Marra, an emotive 68-year-old former decathlete who not only coaches them in Eugene but also married them there after getting ordained online.Their training break after the worlds — two and a half months, longer than most — gave them time to recharge before the final Rio push. The break included visits to Japan, Mozambique and Kenya, but it also gave Brianne time to process her paralysis by analysis in Beijing.She revisited it in September at an athletes’ retreat in Montreal organized by B2ten, a privately funded group that supports Canadian Olympians. The athletes were asked to share their biggest regret, and as they told their stories, Brianne kept saying to herself, “I can relate to that,” she said.AdvertisementA silver medalist at worlds in 2013 and 2015, Brianne is convinced the key element to gold in Rio will be mental: focusing on herself, not her rivals. In the search for answers, she has allowed Penny Werthner, the Canadian Olympic team’s sports psychologist, to regularly hook her up to a machine that provides biofeedback and neurofeedback.“She literally places things on my head that read my brain waves, and it gets my body temperature, my skin conductances, respiration and all this stuff,” Brianne said. “You play these games where you have to learn what focus is for you. And once you get the focus, there are hard numbers that prove it.”But sometimes the reality of Brianne’s training life, and of sharing daily workouts and a coach with her decathlon-dominating husband, has worked against her confidence.“Sometimes it’s difficult,” Brianne said, “because when you train with the best athlete in the world, I’m always the worst one.”Revisiting Beijing remains a raw experience. A few days earlier, Brianne finally talked and cried it through with Werthner, and she breaks down again discussing it in a cafe in downtown Eugene.“I think sometimes as an athlete you feel, like, very alone,” she says. “I’m lucky I have Ashton because when stuff happens, we have these very separate lives from the regular world. I know other people in other jobs probably do feel the same way, but we don’t go out. We don’t see our families. Our friends think we’re weird.”The Montreal retreat, she says, was reassuring.“I’m like, O.K., we’re not the only weird ones,” she says. “And at least I have Ashton, and at least we keep each other sane, because sometimes I wonder, what am I doing?”The Eatons and Marra granted unusual access this season in part because track and field, once mainstream in North America, is now little understood compared with the 20th-century days when the world’s greatest decathlete — be it Jim Thorpe or Bruce Jenner — was much closer to synonymous with the world’s greatest athlete.AdvertisementBut what genuinely moves the masses surely cannot be imposed, and Ashton himself is a reflection of a cultural shift. Raised in a small Oregon town by a single white mother, he was drawn to track and field by Michael Johnson’s golden-spiked 200-400 double at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.Marra argues that the end of the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union has played a role in track and field’s declining relevance. But there is also the scandal factor, a notion reinforced over the past year as Russian athletes were barred from competition after an investigation by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed widespread and systemic doping in Russia.That crisis has affected all athletes, even the Eatons. When it broke, Sebastian Coe, the new president of track and field’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, canceled the sports’s annual gala in Monaco, which was to honor Ashton as the world’s male athlete of the year. This was a rare honor for a decathlete, all the more so in a year when Usain Bolt, the sport’s only true global attraction, won three more golds at the world championships.But Ashton expressed no disappointment, only deep discomfort with the state of his sport.“What I feel like I’m doing is showing people what is humanly possible when someone commits their entire life to something,” he said. “That’s what my performance is, and that’s powerful to me. And when I have people question the validity of that, I think, why am I doing it? And that’s really, really tough for me to take.”He said it had come to a point where he had no interest in reforming the sport from within, and he has even insisted on being removed from the I.A.A.F.’s athlete advisory committee, a post to which he said he was named without his agreement. When he retires, he said, he plans to sever his ties other than to work with youth and developmental programs.“The sport was so great, and there are great things about it, but you have all this negative” stuff, he said. “It’s just like, well, it’s that much easier to just leave behind.”It is the coldest Valentine’s Day here in more than 80 years — minus 9 Fahrenheit — and as late-arriving fans unwind their scarves inside Reggie Lewis Center, Marra is wielding an imaginary rake and shouting to the crew working the long-jump pit.Marra is concerned the landing area is too hard, which means an increased chance of injury for Brianne, who is competing here — along with Ashton — in her first significant meet of the Olympic year. Marra wants the sand in the pit re-raked to create more cushion.Advertisement“The decathlon and the heptathlon are basically an injury looking for a place to happen,” Marra says.
CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times        Reducing risk is an obsession, particularly for a veteran like Marra, who has spent more than 40 years coaching multi-event athletes but whose first world or Olympic champion was Ashton.“It scared the hell out of me leading up to London,” Marra said of injury worries ahead of the 2012 Games. “But I don’t worry about it as much these days because I have so much confidence in them and their instincts. If I don’t shut it down in practice, they’ll know when to shut it down.”Neither Eaton has had a major injury in more than six years working with Marra, whose mantra is that he wants the two to compete in Rio “90 percent in shape and 100 percent healthy.”There are still concerns. Ashton had back and Achilles’ tendon problems before Beijing, and he experienced knee problems as well as a torn quadriceps in the month before the Olympic trials. Part of the reason he weighs only 182 pounds and does limited powerlifting, he and Marra said, is to lighten the load on his joints.Brianne has continuing back and intercostal troubles of her own, and only two weeks before the Boston meet, she had a jabbing pain in her shin that felt like a stress fracture she had sustained earlier in her career. Back home in Eugene, her existing doubts resurgent, she had what she called “a full-blown breakdown.”“I’m looking up how long it takes to heal a stress fracture: eight weeks, no impact at the longest,” she said. “So I go upstairs, and I’m bawling, just bawling having a meltdown. I don’t think Ashton has ever seen that. And I’m saying: ‘What if I can’t go to the Olympics? I’ve trained all this time. What if I can’t go?’”Subsequent tests ruled out a stress fracture, but not before Brianne and Ashton had written down all the potential repercussions of an eight-week layoff on a piece of paper under the heading “The Reality of the Situation.” The false alarm was a reminder of the offstage angst that so many athletes endure, but it also allowed Brianne to use her work on mental preparation to find the positives.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The result overturns the preconception that combined-event athletes — with all those disparate skills they need to polish — must be training around the clock. In fact, the Eatons sometimes train for no more than two hours a day.The bigger fitness push came in 2015, when two-a-day sessions were a staple in order to build a platform for success in Rio. Why not go hard two years in a row?“If you are on the drugs, you can do that, but we don’t do that stuff,” Marra said.Marra does not work for the Eatons directly; his salary is paid by the Nike-funded Oregon Track Club Elite, an arrangement he said he preferred. “I’m old school,” Marra said. “If you are coaching a guy and he is paying you and you want to chew him out, it just doesn’t work.”Marra, an extrovert and self-described “little Italian peacock,” has a reassuring, gravelly laugh, but his hail-fellow-well-met manner comes in the face of some personal adversity. He is often separated from his own family: 260 days in 2014 by his count. This season, his wife, Madeline, is not with him in Eugene, living temporarily with their adult son Andy in Reno, Nev., to help Andy recover after a car accident and a lost job.Marra’s sister died in November after a life spent battling rheumatoid arthritis, and Marra has a physical deformity of his own to deal with: Dupuytren’s contracture, which has left some of his fingers contorted.Marra can still summon the muscle memory and enthusiasm to move like a much younger man when he demonstrates his ideal javelin throw. But there is a price for this.“At night, he’s hobbling up and down stairs,” said Don Butzner, the Eatons’ massage therapist. “The behind-the-scenes Harry has a lot of stress. He’s got a wife that has sacrificed decades to help him be where he’s at. She’s a big part of his life. She’s important to him, and his kids are hugely important to him, and he wasn’t around them as much as he would have liked to have been. The sacrifices he’s made are significant, and I think if Ash and Bri can pull it off, he’ll be able to look in the mirror and think it was all worth it.”To watch the Eatons’ practices is to watch choreography: attention to the finest points of movement. “I would say 90 percent of the stuff we do is technical anyway,” Ashton said. “If you look at a two-hour training day, 12 minutes are probably spent running or gaining fitness.”AdvertisementThere is also steady communication — not just spoken as Marra and the Eatons push each other toward more precision. At this advanced stage they are all bilingual in English and body language. To deepen the exchange, Harry has created notebooks for each event with what he calls cues: the equivalent of swing thoughts in golf. His javelin notebook has 34 different cues: short phrases like “Stay Closed or “Hand Tall in Back.”But reaching Ashton and reaching Brianne remain two very different challenges. While Ashton is an intuitive pupil, preferring to ponder the crux of most problems internally, Brianne favors more explicit instruction. Asked how he managed these different schools of thought, Marra, stretched out on a bed in a Boston hotel, joked, “That’s why I’m lying down.”It is late April. Brianne has been having nightmares about breaking 7,000 points for the first time and still not winning the gold. Marra, too, keeps waking in the middle of the night.“Three in the morning the last few days,” Marra says over lunch one afternoon. “I’m thinking about the workouts. I can fall asleep in a heartbeat and put that out of my mind in a heartbeat, but then three or four hours of sleep, and I’ll wake right up, and I’ll think: ‘Discus, damn it, how can I say this better? Or get this point across better?’”The Olympics are closer, and the rise in intensity in the Eatons’ camp is palpable.On the track at Westmont College, Ashton and Marra clash over technique, eliciting a rare vulgarity and flash of pique from Ashton. Marra keeps his cool.“Watch my turn: Where am I turning?” he says, demonstrating again.Ashton throws the discus again. “There you go,” Marra says encouragingly.“No, absolutely not,” Ashton responds. “We’re not agreeing on this.”So it continues under a cloudless sky, and although Marra says “last one” at least three times, Ashton continues to throw, finding little apparent satisfaction before finally deciding he is done.Marra later explains he accepts that such tense exchanges are inevitable, that athletes need to vent. Ashton agrees. “I honestly think we would probably have broken down any other coach,” Ashton says.AdvertisementOver the course of the year, the Eatons do little to hide their darker moments, willingly blasting their mistakes and frustrations out to their internet followers.The material posted on the couple’s well-stocked website and social media feeds reflects this. There are a series of videos labeled “Struggle.” In one of these, Brianne shouts at herself through a series of imperfect shot-put attempts. The priority, though, remains managing her mind, and for Brianne, data is much more convincing than another heart-to-heart talk. That was one reason she embraced neurofeedback.“Most athletes I know that are good are real driven individuals, and they don’t like what I call the idling state,” Werthner, her psychologist, explained. “They think, ‘What else can I do?’ And there’s a good part to that, but it’s exhausting at some point.“During training, especially in the off-season, you can get away with that, but the closer and closer we get to competition, we also then start thinking: ‘What if all that training doesn’t pay off? What if I screw up?’ And those are normal thoughts, normal concerns, normal fears, but they don’t help us. And the reason they don’t is because they physiologically affect us.”Being monitored in a laboratory or at home is not equivalent to competing in Rio’s Olympic Stadium. But Werthner insists that the benefits of being able to identify an optimal state of mind or breathing pattern are real. She said that Brianne was now much more able to downshift on her own, and from the outside, the work they have done together seems to have produced encouraging results.The Eatons have already won gold medals at the same meet in 2016, at the world indoor championships in Portland, Ore., in March, when Brianne won the pentathlon and Ashton the heptathlon.To an outsider, the Eatons can seem more like colleagues than a married couple at this fraught stage, when date nights are rare and discussions of training technique are not. But they are also looking beyond the Games. After Portland, the Eatons made time for a short trip to Colorado, where they mulled a post-Olympic move to the mountains despite having to scout locations while driving in a heavy snowstorm.Back in the California sunshine, the focus on Rio has returned. Asked if the double golds in Portland lightened the psychological load going into the Olympics, both Eatons answer simultaneously, “No.”AdvertisementTheir likely rivals in Rio were absent in Portland: Damian Warner of Canada for Ashton, Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson of Britain for Brianne. But there was still angst, which was why Ashton’s hotel phone rang at 2:15 a.m. the night before they competed. It was Brianne, calling from the Canadian team hotel. She could not sleep, and Ashton had the NyQuil.“I was in my pajamas, at 2:30 in the morning, running through the streets, tears in my eyes,” Brianne said.She spent the night with Ashton, but both were up by 7. Soon the Canadian team nutritionist Trent Stellingwerff was helpfully showing a concerned Brianne data confirming that athletes can win medals on little sleep.Using her new tools to locate her focused state, Brianne came from behind to snatch the gold with a personal-best time of 2 minutes 9.99 seconds in the final event, the 800 meters. Ashton remembers above all his wife’s face as he shouted encouragement at her down the stretch: a brightness in the eyes and a new set to the jaw that went with a palpable shift in posture and stride.“And Ash was like, ‘How do you find that yourself?’” Brianne said of that look, that winning look.With the Olympic track and field meet about to begin, that seems to be — for both Eatons — the most pressing question.An earlier version of this article misidentified the son with whom Madeline Marra was living.
