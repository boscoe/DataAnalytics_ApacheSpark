With three weeks down in the N.F.L.’s regular season, many teams are sitting pretty: The New England Patriots (even without Tom Brady), the Denver Broncos, the Baltimore Ravens, the Minnesota Vikings and the Philadelphia Eagles all have perfect 3-0 starts.But four teams are on the wrong side of the ledger. It is a deep hole to climb out of: No 0-3 team has rallied to make the playoffs since the Buffalo Bills in 1998.Can any of this year’s 0-3 teams turn things around? Or will one of them achieve the holy grail of incompetence: the 0-16 season, accomplished only by the 2008 Detroit Lions?Here are the ignoble four:FIRST LOSS 27-23 to the Green Bay Packers. A decent effort that ended with a failed fourth-and-1 conversion attempt at Green Bay’s 14-yard line.AdvertisementSECOND LOSS 38-14 at the San Diego Chargers. A rout in which the Jaguars were never close.THIRD LOSS 19-17 to the Ravens, on a 54-yard field goal with about a minute left.AdvertisementTOP PASSER, RUSHER AND RECEIVER Blake Bortles, 843 yards; T. J. Yeldon, 84; Allen Robinson, 183.POINT DIFFERENTIAL Minus-30.COMPUTER RANKING Jeff Sagarin, 27th; Kenneth Massey, 31st; FiveThirtyEight’s  Elo Rating, 31st.A PLAYER SAID “It’s a long season; there’s a lot of ball left. We’re not where we wanted to be by any means, but we’re still excited to have 13 more opportunities to play and win.” — BortlesTHE NEWS MEDIA SAID “There are times in a quarterback’s N.F.L. life, especially one considered a long-term answer at the position, when it’s an absolute must to stand tall in game-deciding moments. Sunday was one of those times for third-year Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles. And surprisingly, he looked like an overmatched rookie.” — The Florida Times-Union after the loss to the Ravens.NEXT THREE GAMES Colts, at Bears, Raiders.OUTLOOK The Jaguars seem the best positioned of all the 0-3 teams, although that’s not saying much. They were competitive in both of their home games and are only 2 ½-point underdogs to the Indianapolis Colts this week. It helps that in the A.F.C. South, only the Houston Texans have a winning record, and no team has a positive point differential.FIRST LOSS 35-34 to the Oakland Raiders. New Orleans yielded a touchdown and a 2-point conversion in the final minute.SECOND LOSS 16-13 at the Giants, on a field goal as time expired.THIRD LOSS 45-32 to the Falcons. Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman racked up more than 200 all-purpose yards against New Orleans.TOP PASSER, RUSHER, RECEIVER Drew Brees, 1,062 yards; Mark Ingram, 165; Willie Snead, 226.POINT DIFFERENTIAL Minus-17.AdvertisementRANKING Sagarin, 28; Massey, 30; FiveThirtyEight, 27.A PLAYER SAID “That was embarrassing. We knew what they were going to do, and they just came out and did exactly what we expected.” — free safety Jairus Byrd after the loss to the Falcons.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Still, with a few breaks, the Saints could be 2-1, and their division, the N.F.C. South, is weak.FIRST LOSS  23-14 at the Texans. Chicago’s Jay Cutler was sacked five times.SECOND LOSS 29-14 to the Eagles. Cutler injured his thumb.THIRD LOSS 31-17 at the Dallas Cowboys, with Brian Hoyer playing for Cutler.TOP PASSER, RUSHER, RECEIVER Hoyer, 395 yards; Jeremy Langford, 116; Alshon Jeffery, 271.POINT DIFFERENTIAL Minus-38 (league’s worst).RANKING Sagarin, 29; Massey, 29; FiveThirtyEight, 29.A PLAYER SAID “It’s frustrating, but our time is coming.” — Jeffery.THE NEWS MEDIA SAID “They haven’t come close to putting together anything resembling an entire game yet this season.” — The Chicago Tribune after the loss to the Cowboys.NEXT THREE GAMES Lions, at Colts, Jaguars.OUTLOOK The next three teams on their schedule have two wins combined. But Coach John Fox’s suggestion that Cutler might not start when he returns from his injury could ignite a quarterback controversy the team does not need.FIRST LOSS 29-10 at the Eagles, a 12th straight opening-game loss for Cleveland. The Browns’ starting quarterback, Robert Griffin III, was injured.AdvertisementSECOND LOSS 25-20 to the Ravens, after Cleveland led by 20. The Browns’ starting quarterback, Josh McCown, was injured.THIRD LOSS  30-24 in overtime at the Dolphins. The newly signed kicker Cody Parkey missed three field-goal attempts. Cody Kessler was the Browns’ third starting quarterback in three weeks.TOP PASSER, RUSHER, RECEIVER McCown, 260 yards; Isaiah Crowell, 274; Terrelle Pryor, 244.POINT DIFFERENTIAL Minus-30.RANKING Sagarin, 32; Massey, 32; FiveThirtyEight, 30.THE COACH SAID “I do want everyone to know we’re not tanking the season. I’m not after the first pick.” — Hue Jackson.THE NEWS MEDIA SAID “Cleveland Browns Are Losing, but Not Playing Like Clowns.” —  The Plain Dealer of Cleveland in a headline after the loss to the Dolphins.NEXT THREE GAMES at Redskins, at Patriots, at Titans.OUTLOOK What a surprise. The Browns, 3-13 last season, are at the bottom of this list, too. On Sunday, they play the struggling Washington Redskins — and are between 7 and 9 ½-point underdogs. Then comes a trip to New England for Brady’s return. Gulp. If anyone is going 0-16, this is the team.A version of this article appears in print on September 29, 2016, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Four Teams Are in a Hole That Could Bottom Out at 0-16.
