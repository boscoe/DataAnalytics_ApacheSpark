CHICAGO — A few blocks north of Wrigley Field sits the final resting place of Ernie Banks, the eternally ebullient Mr. Cub. His grave site, on the edges of a pond and shaded by leafy trees at Graceland Cemetery, was adorned Sunday with several bouquets of wilting red roses and yellow mums, and a small white towel emblazoned with a blue W.Two young women wearing Cubs caps laid pennies on the towel to mark their visit. A man passing by with a group said, “We need you tonight, Ernie.”The broad diaspora that follows the Chicago Cubs carries with it a unique mix of fatalism and optimism, bracing for the inevitable heartbreak but never letting it dull the belief that the long wait for a championship — now at 108 years — may finally be ending.On a night when those competing emotions coursed through a packed-to-the-rafters Wrigley Field, the Cubs kept their hopes of a World Series title alive Sunday by beating back the Cleveland Indians and their own nerves with a 3-2 victory.AdvertisementThe win narrowed the Indians’ lead to three games to two and sent the Series back to Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night.

No team has come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the World Series since Kansas City in 1985, and no team has done so on the road since Pittsburgh in 1979. But there is no franchise more used to heading into the winds of the past.AdvertisementIf history is with the Indians, the Cubs can take solace knowing they will have Jake Arrieta — who carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning in Game 2 — on the mound and Kyle Schwarber back in the lineup as the designated hitter.They will also carry momentum with them.When closer Aroldis Chapman, who got the final eight outs — most of them high tension — struck out Jose Ramirez to end the game, the crowd, already on its feet, roared its approval, exhaling for what seemed like the first time in a game that lasted nearly three and a half hours.“A lot of people in Chicago have not seen a World Series game win,” said first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who led several players back onto the field to thank the fans who had witnessed the Cubs’ first Series win at home since their last trip in 1945. “I’m sure it’s emotional for everyone. It’s emotional for us.”The anxiety around Wrigleyville, where restaurants and bars have been packed by lunchtime the last three days, was so evident that Cubs Manager Joe Maddon was asked if he had any calming words.He did not.“Please be nervous,” Maddon said before the game. “Absolutely. You should be nervous. We have to win tonight, so go ahead and be nervous. It’s up to us to get you beyond that moment and get back to Cleveland.”The players tried to turn their clubhouse into a comfortable cocoon as the Cubs, their 103 regular season wins notwithstanding, embraced their underdog circumstance.Advertisement“It was Rizzo playing the Rocky theme and running and jumping around half-naked doing boxing moves,” catcher David Ross said.The Cubs, who had scored just seven runs in the first four games of the Series, had to get off the mat after Ramirez gave the Indians a 1-0 lead with a home run in the second off Jon Lester. They did so in the fourth, when they got a leadoff homer from Kris Bryant, a run-scoring dribbler from Addison Russell and a sacrifice fly from Ross to take a 3-1 lead against Trevor Bauer.They spent the rest of the night hanging onto it for dear life, thanks to superb defense — particularly from Rizzo, who scooped three balls out of the dirt and was there to make a jugging catch when a pop-up bounced out of Ross’s glove — and thanks to Chapman’s high-wire act.The Indians stranded a runner at third in the fifth, and they closed to within 3-2 when Francisco Lindor’s two-out, two-strike single off Lester scored Rajai Davis in the sixth.Chapman retired Roberto Perez on a grounder with two aboard to end the seventh, then escaped a self-inflicted mess in the eighth. With one out, Chapman forgot to cover first when Davis slapped a pitch down the first-base line. Rizzo made a diving stop, but when he picked himself up to throw to first, Chapman had hardly moved off the mound.“If Chappy had covered first base, there would have been a lot less angst going on,” Maddon said.Davis stole second, and after Jason Kipnis flied out to left, Davis took third without a throw after Chapman all but ignored him.Chapman then struck out Lindor, who took a called third strike on the outside corner. It was the third time the Indians took a borderline called strike from the plate umpire Tony Randazzo, all of them with runners in scoring position.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He shared the Most Valuable Player Award with Lester in the National League Championship Series.After Bryant led off the fourth with a home run to tie the score, Rizzo doubled, and Ben Zobrist singled him to third. The Cubs took the lead when Russell hit a dribbler down the first-base line for a hit. And after Heyward struck out, Baez laid down a perfect bunt just where Russell had hit the ball, loading the bases.Though Maddon had Schwarber — the slugger who returned for the Series from April knee ligament surgery — available to pinch-hit, he stayed with Ross, who delivered a sacrifice fly that put the Cubs ahead, 3-1. Lester was allowed to hit and struck out to end the inning.Lester, who had buzzed through the first four innings, allowing only Ramirez’s home run, stranded Carlos Santana at third in the fifth, getting a borderline called third strike on Brandon Guyer to end a nine-pitch at-bat and retiring Perez on a groundout.Lester nearly wiggled out of a bind in the sixth, getting Kipnis on another disputed called third strike with Davis on second. But Lester left a two-out, two-strike fastball up in the zone for Lindor and he lined it into center field, scoring Davis and bringing the Indians to within 3-2.The rest of the night was an exercise in patience and pleading for the crowd, but in the end — as “Sweet Home Chicago” blared and W banners were waved — all was well. The Cubs were alive, and next year could continue to wait.A version of this article appears in print on October 31, 2016, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Cubs Aren’t History.
