Dickey, the 42-year-old knuckleball pitcher, signed a one-year free-agent deal to pitch for the Atlanta Braves, a team with a rich history of knuckleballers.Phil Niekro pitched with the Braves for 21 seasons, and his brother Joe spent two years there, 1973 and 1974. Hoyt Wilhelm also spent parts of three seasons with the Braves, in 1969, 1970 and 1971.Dickey spent the last four seasons with the Blue Jays and contemplated retirement this year when he was not included on Toronto’s postseason roster. But after he became a free agent, he decided to sign a one-year deal with an option for another to pitch for a team that is about 250 miles from his home in Nashville.Dickey pitched three years with the Mets and won the 2012 National League Cy Young Award in his final season there.In December of that year, the Mets traded him, along with catchers Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas, in a blockbuster deal to the Blue Jays for Travis d’Arnaud, Wuilmer Becerra, John Buck and a top pitching prospect named Noah Syndergaard.Dickey broke in with the Texas Rangers in 2001 and has compiled a 110-108 record with a 4.01 earned run average with five teams. The Mets signed him to a minor league free-agent deal in 2010, and after six weeks at Class AAA Buffalo, he was inserted into the Mets' starting rotation and enjoyed the most success of his career.Advertisement
