For a guy who has not played in a competitive football game in almost four years, Tim Tebow has a way of making news and polarizing opinion.Tebow, in a video posted to his Instagram account Thursday night, seemed to deny reports that he will speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next Thursday.“It’s amazing how fast rumors fly, and that’s exactly what it is — a rumor,” Tebow said in the 27-second video.A roster of speakers obtained by The New York Times had earlier suggested that Tebow would speak on the fourth and final night of the event. Although the astronaut Eileen Collins, the billionaire Peter Thiel and many Republican dignitaries were among those on the list, Tebow — who started 16 games in the N.F.L. — had drawn the most attention.AdvertisementAfter a Heisman Trophy career at Florida, Tebow headed for the N.F.L. In his second season with the Denver Broncos, he took over as starting quarterback and had a magical run, putting up mediocre statistics but leading the team to win after win.AdvertisementThe contradictory nature of the season led fans to rush to one of two camps: Some felt Tebow was overrated and lucky, while others saw him as an almost mystical embodiment of the will to win. There were few who sought the sensible center.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He landed briefly with the Jets and played in the preseason for the Eagles in 2015, but at age 28, he appears to have ended his N.F.L. career.The division over Tebow was compounded by his outspoken Christianity. After big plays, he prayed on the field in a kneeling position that soon became known as Tebowing. He has also advocated sexual abstinence before marriage, and he appeared in an anti-abortion group’s advertisement during the 2010 Super Bowl.Before he posted his video, the news of his appearance at the Republican convention fired up people on both sides of the political divide, as well as online comedians.
            Republicans got Tim Tebow to speak at their convention because they're not going to win much outside the Deep South either

            I'm so tired of people downing Tim Tebow. For what? Is it jealousy? Do people just not like decency in others?        Even without Tebow, the world of sports will be represented by Dana White, the outspoken president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is being bought for $4 billion, and Natalie Gulbis, a former top golfer who has fallen out of the top 100 and who appeared on Trump’s “Apprentice” television program. Reaction to their appearances was much more muted.
            Vince McMahon’s gotta be steamed that Dana White got his speaking spot        
            Natalie Gulbis is speaking at the Republican National Convention. She must be hitting it to the far right.        In June, Trump spoke about inviting sports stars to the convention and singled out White. “Dana White, you know Dana White?” Trump said. “U.F.C. Guy’s a champion.”Trump has a history with Tebow. The Washington Post reported this month that Trump had successfully bid $12,000 for a signed Tebow helmet at a charity auction but used money from his nonprofit foundation to do so.Athletes and other celebrities have spoken at conventions, although their talks are often more anodyne than rabble-rousing.AdvertisementAmong the sports figures who have appeared at Republican conventions in recent years were Mike Eruzione, Joe Gibbs and Dwayne Johnson, the wrestler and actor known as the Rock.A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2016, on Page B11 of the New York edition.
