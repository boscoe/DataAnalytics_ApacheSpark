The Sablich brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The New York Times since 2010. See their weekly player rankings and visit 5thDownFantasy.com for more fantasy analysis. You can also ask them questions through their Twitter account, @5thdownfantasy.Matt Ryan (ATL vs. Chiefs) — This should be a week in which Ryan returns to elite status, and just in time to help his fantasy owners make the playoffs. He has had two down weeks since his 27-point outburst in Week 9, but we can chalk that up to tough matchups against the Eagles and the Cardinals. This week, he plays the Chiefs, who have yielded at least 22 fantasy points to three of the last four quarterbacks they have faced, and the sixth most fantasy points to the position over all.Colin Kaepernick (SF at Bears) — In every game since the 49ers’ Week 8 bye, Kaepernick has been either a top 10 fantasy quarterback or has scored at least 20 fantasy points, including his 34 points last week, which led all other quarterbacks. There is little reason to think he won’t produce a quality fantasy performance against the Bears, who have given up two touchdowns to opposing quarterbacks in each of the last three games and have not faced a running threat like Kaepernick.Sleeper: Matt Barkley (CHI vs. 49ers)Proceed With Caution: Ben Roethlisberger (PIT vs. Giants)Jordan Howard (CHI vs. 49ers) — With 5.1 yards per carry, Howard is second only to Miami’s Jay Ajayi and will match up against the league’s worst run defense this week. Howard should top 20 fantasy points, something he has not done since Week 8 against the Vikings. He has also been a safe play in PPR leagues throughout the season, falling below 10 fantasy points only twice since Week 3.AdvertisementLeSean McCoy (BUF at Raiders) — A no-brainer start when healthy — and he was healthy enough last week to score 27 fantasy points — he should justify his hefty price in daily fantasy leagues against the Raiders, who have given up at least 14 fantasy points to a running back in each of the last four games.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard scoring formats and will be updated each week.            Theo Riddick (DET at Saints) — He is the ultimate boom-or-bust running back play in standard leagues, but should be a safe play in PPR leagues against the Saints, who allow the fifth most fantasy points to the position. The oddsmakers in Vegas like this game to be the highest scoring one of the week. While much of that will come from Drew Brees’s antics, Riddick should be at the center of the Lions’ efforts to keep up.AdvertisementSleeper: Rashad Jennings (NYG at Steelers)Proceed With Caution: Thomas Rawls (SEA vs. Panthers)Michael Thomas (NO vs. Lions) — As mentioned before, this could be the highest scoring game of the week, and you’ll want to get some Saints receivers in your starting lineup, if at all possible. Thomas is coming off a two-touchdown performance against the Rams, and he leads all Saints receivers, including Brandin Cooks, in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns.Julio Jones (ATL vs. Chiefs) — He has proved to be a riskier play this season than expected, but he has also put up some monster games along the way. He still leads all receivers in receiving yards and is 10th in targets. If you buy into the idea of Ryan’s bouncing back against the Chiefs, why not stack him with Jones in daily leagues? I expect this to be a boom performance rather than a bust.Marquess Wilson (CHI vs. 49ers) — Somebody has to catch passes in the Bears offense with Alshon Jeffery suspended, and last week that person was Wilson, who ended up catching eight of 11 targets for 125 yards and a touchdown. Wilson seems to be the only receiver who is locked in with Matt Barkley, Jay Cutler’s replacement at quarterback, making him an interesting streaming option at receiver this week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Graham has the fourth most fantasy points at the position, and the second most receiving yards of any tight end (706).Sleeper: Coby Fleener (NO vs. Lions)Proceed With Caution: Jordan Reed (WAS at Cardinals)Defense/Special TeamsStart: NE vs. Rams; BAL vs. Dolphins.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
