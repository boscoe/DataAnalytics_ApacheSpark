MELBOURNE, Australia — There was no easing into a title defense for Novak Djokovic, starting his Australian Open against the man who upset Rafael Nadal here last year in the first round.He lifted when he most needed to Tuesday night, holding off Fernando Verdasco in a 71-minute, momentum-swinging second set before winning 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-2. There were glares, stares and frustrated outbursts from both players who met in a tense semifinal earlier this month in Doha, where Djokovic won after saving five match points.“When I saw the draw, I thought to myself this is going to be the only match I’m going to focus on,” said Djokovic, aiming to be the first man to win seven Australian titles. “If he’s on, you never know.“I started well with a great intensity. First and third sets went well, second set was a gamble — pretty close.”AdvertisementNadal, on the comeback from a couple of months on the sidelines following the U.S. Open with an injured left wrist, had a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Florian Mayer to go one better than he did last year in Australia.Advertisement“I’m happy to do an interview with you — last year, I didn’t have the chance!” Nadal said in his on-court interview.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
