But the juxtaposition 112 years apart between the Yankees’ rookie outfielder Dustin Fowler and Archibald Wright Graham, better known as Moonlight Graham, is as astounding as it is unfortunate.Fowler, 22, was called up Thursday from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make his major league debut against the Chicago White Sox. In the bottom of the first inning, he ruptured the patella tendon in his right knee trying to chase down a foul ball along the right-field line at Guaranteed Rate Field.Fowler was due to lead off the top of the second inning. Instead, he headed to a Chicago hospital for surgery, and he will miss the rest of the season without making a plate appearance.The story of Moonlight Graham was part of the 1989 movie “Field of Dreams,” starring Kevin Costner. Graham played one game for the New York Giants on June 29, 1905 — also a Thursday — against the Brooklyn Superbas at Washington Park in Brooklyn.In an 11-1 win, Graham played right field for one inning without recording an out. He was on deck to bat in the top of the ninth, but his teammate Claude Elliott flied out to end the inning.Graham never played another game in the major leagues. The Giants sold him to minor league Scranton and he left baseball after the 1908 season, eventually becoming a physician in Chisholm, Minn. He died at 87 in 1965.Graham’s unique career synopsis in the Baseball Encyclopedia caught the attention of the novelist W. P. Kinsella when he was writing “Shoeless Joe,” which was published in 1982 and became the basis for the movie in which Costner’s character, Ray Kinsella, meets Graham (played by Burt Lancaster) in a back-in-time scene.Advertisement
