The next day, she will be the star attraction there.Porsche announced on Tuesday that Sharapova, 29, would make her return to tennis at its WTA tournament in Stuttgart, receiving a wild card to play the indoor clay event where she is a three-time champion and a prominent spokeswoman for the title sponsor automaker.“I could not be happier to have my first match back on tour at one of my favorite tournaments,” Sharapova said in a statement from Porsche.Markus Günthardt, the tournament director, called Sharapova’s planned return “a fabulous present for our fantastic spectators and is certain to be one of the sporting and emotional highlights of our anniversary tournament.”At the Australian Open last year, Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, a Latvian cardiac medicine popular with Russian athletes, which caused waves of positive tests early last year when it was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list. She was initially barred for two years by the International Tennis Federation, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced her suspension by nine months in October.Although an obvious choice for a comeback, Stuttgart was thought to be out of reach for Sharapova. The tournament’s main draw starts on April 24, the penultimate day of her 15-month suspension.But the tournament will ensure that Sharapova does not play her first-round match until Wednesday, April 26, the first day she is reinstated as eligible to compete. The scheduling is not uncommon at the event; last year, five of the 12 first-round matches there were played on Wednesday because of Fed Cup matches being held around the world the previous weekend.“With that, we can kind of set the schedule and say that even though she’s not eligible to play on Monday or Tuesday, she can play on Wednesday,” Viktoria Wohlrapp, a spokeswoman for Porsche Tennis, said. “We could have never made an exception for her — that would have never worked — to say she could play her first round on the Wednesday. But due to the fact that we have always had that in the past, it’s not something that we’re inventing just for her.”The I.T.F.’s antidoping rules prohibit ineligible players from being granted accreditation or access to tournaments during suspensions, but allow for Sharapova to apply for tournaments while still ineligible. There were no specific rules prohibiting Sharapova from being placed in the draw and held in a purgatorial state while the final days tick off her ban.“The WTA looked at this back and forth from all directions, and they confirmed to us that it’s possible,” Wohlrapp said. “So we offered her the wild card, and she took it.”Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, was in the top 10 at the time of her positive test, but she will have zero ranking points when she returns to the tour. She will need to rely on future wild cards to be able to compete in spring tournaments, including the French Open, which she has won twice. With early successes, Sharapova could rebuild her ranking enough to enter Wimbledon directly, an effort greatly aided by the boost from Porsche.There is little precedent for this sort of arrangement for a player coming off a ban, but Wohlrapp insisted there had been no “special treatment” for Sharapova.“The first day she is going to be officially on site is going to be the day when the ban is over; we’re sticking to that totally,” Wohlrapp said. “I want to make that very clear: We’re very happy that she’s coming, but we also like the other players, and as good as the relationship is with Maria and our collaboration the last three years, we cannot allow ourselves to make any sort of exceptions for her, in regards to fairness toward the other players.”Sharapova has been able to play unsanctioned exhibitions during her suspension, including a World TeamTennis fund-raiser in Las Vegas in October and a match in San Juan against the Puerto Rican gold medalist Monica Puig in front of a crowd of 12,163 in December. Sharapova has not played a match on tour since losing to Serena Williams in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open last January.Advertisement
