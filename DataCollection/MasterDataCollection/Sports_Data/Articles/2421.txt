Dolan, that he got into a verbal altercation with a fan outside the Garden on Tuesday night.Dolan told Deadspin that he confronted the fan, Mike Hamersky, a season-ticket holder and a lawyer who lives in Queens, when Hamersky yelled at him before the Knicks took on the Chicago Bulls.Hamersky told Deadspin the altercation began when he spotted Dolan walking past him and shouted at him to sell the team. Dolan acknowledged to Deadspin that he grew angry when he heard the comment and asked who had made it. When Hamersky identified himself, Dolan confronted him and ended up cursing at him, Dolan told Deadspin.Dolan also told Deadspin that Hamersky “smelled of alcohol” and that he had told Hamersky he would not be permitted into the arena for the game. Hamersky said that he did get into the game — which the Knicks actually won, 100-91 — and that although he was drinking a beer when he yelled at Dolan, he was not intoxicated. He had just come from Fordham University, where he was teaching a law class, he said.The altercation occurred two months after an incident at the Garden in which the former Knick Charles Oakley was led away in handcuffs. Security guards confronted Oakley as he was sitting near Dolan and, according to the Garden, acting belligerently.Dolan initially barred Oakley from returning to the Garden and also suggested, without providing any proof, that Oakley might have a problem with alcohol.The incident on Tuesday also came two years after Dolan wrote a caustic email to a 72-year-old Knicks fan in Brooklyn who had written to him to urge him to sell the team.“You are a sad person,” Dolan said in the email. “Start rooting for the Nets because the Knicks don’t want you.”On Wednesday night, Dolan, through a public relations representative, issued a statement that addressed the latest confrontation, saying, “No one should come to an event at the Garden feeling as though it is O.K. to be verbally abusive or disrespectful to anyone — including the owner of the arena.”Hamersky, in a telephone interview, said he never cursed once at Dolan during the altercation. He also said he would probably renew his season tickets.Advertisement
