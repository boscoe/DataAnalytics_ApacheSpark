Uchimura, the six-time world champion, put on a spectacular show with four difficult release moves that earned him a dazzling 15.8.Verniaiev, knowing he needed a 14.9 to win, took a slightly different approach in hopes of winning Ukraine’s first ever all-around Olympic gold in the sport: an easier, less risky routine. He earned a 14.8.Uchimura finished with a total of 92.365, just ahead of Verniaiev’s 92.266, to become the first man to successfully defend his title since his countryman Sawao Kato in 1972.“Six world championships and two Olympic wins in eight years is a great victory,” Uchimura told Reuters.Max Whitlock of Britain was third, just ahead of David Belyavskiy of Russia. The American Sam Mikulak recovered from a fall on vault to rally for a seventh-place finish.Rafael Nadal went from a full day to a day off after rain forced the postponement of all 26 Olympic tennis matches — including all three Nadal had been scheduled to play.All three matches for Nadal, a 14-time Grand Slam champion who won Olympic gold in 2008, were shifted to Thursday, weather permitting. He will play for Spain in the third round of singles against Gilles Simon of France, in the semifinals of men’s doubles with Marc López against Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil of Canada, and in the first round of mixed doubles with Garbiñe Muguruza against Lucie Hradecka and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic.Near-constant showers also forced the postponement of the match between Andy Murray, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist from Britain, and Fabio Fognini of Italy.Sprinter Justin Gatlin, the American who is considered the biggest threat to the reigning world-record holder Usain Bolt, said he is not paying attention to those who say he should not be competing in Rio because of the doping suspension in his past.“I’ve served that time,” said Gatlin, 34. “I’ve dealt with that punishment. I’ve moved forward.”Some athletes, including the American swimmer Lilly King, have suggested that Gatlin is among the athletes who should not be permitted to compete because of previous sanctions for doping.Gatlin, who won gold at 100 meters at the 2004 Olympics, has been caught using banned substances twice. The first was for amphetamines, though arbitrators determined he had used them to treat attention deficit disorder. The second came for excessive testosterone in 2006 and resulted in a four-year suspension.15 PhotosView Slide Show ›Jeffrey Furticella/The New York TimesKing was asked about Gatlin after her finger-wagging display toward Yulia Efimova, a Russian swimmer who was allowed to compete after a last-minute appeal. Efimova, like Gatlin, has served a doping ban but was reinstated.“Do I think people who have been caught doping should be on the team?” King said. “They shouldn’t.”Mexico, which upset Brazil in the final of the 2012 London Games to capture gold, was eliminated from the 2016 Games with a 1-0 loss to South Korea in Brasília.Kwon Chang-hoon scored in the 77th minute to finish atop Group C with 7 points, 2 more than Germany, which also secured a spot in the quarterfinals with a 10-0 victory over Fiji in Belo Horizonte — in the same stadium where the senior team routed Brazil, 7-1, in the semifinals of the 2014 World Cup. Fiji had already lost by 5-1 to Mexico and by 8-0 to South Korea.ARGENTINA ALSO BOWS OUT Argentina, a two-time Olympic winner, was eliminated with a 1-1 draw against Honduras in Brasília. Both teams finished group play with 4 points, but Honduras advanced on goal difference to join Portugal in the quarterfinals from Group D.Both teams failed to score on penalty kicks before Honduras took the lead in the 75th minute on a penalty from Antony Lozano. Mauricio Martinez tied the game for Argentina on a free kick in extra time.Xiang Yanmei shrugged off a glancing blow to the head from a falling bar to capture gold in the women’s 69-kilogram event.Xiang, who won world titles in 2013 and 2015, was already the favorite for gold in the event when she dropped the 118-kilogram bar on her third attempt in the snatch.Though she briefly appeared dazed and admitted to having had some pain after being struck, Xiang was fully alert as she closed out China’s fourth weight lifting gold of the Rio Olympics.Xiang lifted 116 kilograms in the snatch and 145 kilograms in the clean and jerk for a total of 261 kilograms.Fehaid Al-Deehani, the most decorated Olympic athlete in Kuwait’s history, won the first gold medal of his career in the men’s double trap finals.Al-Deehani, a Kuwaiti army officer competing as an independent because his country’s Olympic committee has been suspended, defeated Marco Innocenti.Al-Deehani is the only Kuwaiti to to earn an Olympic medal.
