The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Golden State Warriors, 87-79, on Saturday. The loss was the Warriors’ first to a team in the N.B.A.’s top tier. Previously, they had been 1-0 against the Spurs, 3-0 against the Oklahoma City Thunder and 2-0 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.The Spurs’ victory, and the ability they showed to disrupt the Warriors’ offense, should not change the discussion around Golden State. But it should open some eyes to San Antonio’s extraordinary season — eyes that had remained stubbornly closed after the Warriors dominated the Spurs, 120-90, when the teams first danced on Jan. 25.The Spurs are 35-0 at home. They are only three games behind the Warriors, a team that remains on pace to tie or break the record for the most wins in a season. Since 2016 began, the Spurs have a better winning percentage than Golden State. All of which is simply to say that although the Warriors have indisputably been the N.B.A.’s top team, the Spurs are so hot on their heels that it is difficult to simply relegate them to second-place status. The Western Conference finals should be a treat.Beyond San Antonio’s performance as a team, Saturday was particularly important for Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge. He had already developed a reputation for shrinking in big games before he joined the team this season, and his January performance against Golden State seemed a confirmation of that. He scored just 5 points on 2-for-9 shooting, with 3 rebounds and a single assist. But Aldridge erased that game from his critics’ memories on Saturday, scoring 26 points, pulling down 13 rebounds and standing in as a frontcourt leader on a night when Tim Duncan played only eight minutes.AdvertisementAs good they are, the Spurs have been far more vulnerable to the N.B.A.’s best than the Warriors have. They have lost to the Cavaliers, the Thunder, the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers. Before Saturday, the Warriors seemed more likely to defeat themselves than to be beaten by superior talent. But the Spurs’ code has been easier for the best teams to crack.

That vulnerability should encourage the Thunder, who are likely to face the Spurs in the second round this postseason. Oklahoma City has two more regular-season games against San Antonio, including one in prime time this Saturday (8 p.m. Eastern, NBA TV), and beating the Spurs could give the Thunder a shot in the arm — something the team desperately needs.Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka are in their seventh season together. They found success early, reaching the N.B.A. finals in 2012. But they have not returned to the finals since James Harden was traded to the Houston Rockets that year, and their chances at achieving greatness with their current roster have started to look slimmer. The Thunder, with 22 losses under their belts, are a great team but are not historically great in the same way as their Western Conference betters.AdvertisementDurant is a free agent this summer, and the Thunder’s playoff performance will go a long way toward determining whether he decides to stay in Oklahoma City. If they do not at least put up a convincing fight in the conference semifinals, it is easy to imagine that he will head elsewhere.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Only 8-8 since the All-Star break, the team often falls apart in the fourth quarter of close games. A home loss to the mediocre Minnesota Timberwolves on March 11 may have been the low point of its season: The Thunder turned the ball over 24 times and lost on a last-second 3-pointer.But that game may have represented a turning point. The Thunder have won four of their five games since, losing only to the Spurs in San Antonio. They have been consistently focused against good teams like the Portland Trail Blazers and the Indiana Pacers. The game against the Pacers on Saturday was particularly impressive, with Durant and Westbrook turning in extraordinary stat lines and Oklahoma City’s bench outscoring Indiana’s, 45-14.Commentators had been hoping that the Thunder’s rookie head coach, Billy Donovan, would change the way that Oklahoma City plays, helping the team to rely more on ball movement and less on its superstars. It is fair to say that he has failed. The Thunder remain a relatively poor passing team, hopelessly dependent on Durant and Westbrook.Luckily for the Thunder, those two players are almost good enough to shoulder the load for the entire team. If Donovan can ensure that the bench contributes as it has recently, and the superstars are dialed in, the Thunder can beat any team in the league, including the Spurs. Can they stay focused enough to do the same in a seven-game series? Save that question for the postseason. It is less than a month away.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
