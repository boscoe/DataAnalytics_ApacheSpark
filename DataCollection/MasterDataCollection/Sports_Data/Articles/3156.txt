SURPRISE, Ariz. —  The Kansas City Royals had Salvador Perez, their All-Star catcher, under control through 2019 with the sweetest of sweetheart deals, one that even at its signing was among the most favorable to the club of any contract in baseball.They decided to rip it up anyway.In a move that Perez’s agent, Rick Thurman, said he had never experienced in all his years in baseball, the Royals gave Perez, a three-time Gold Glove winner, a five-year, $52.5 million contract that was tacked onto this year. It effectively replaced a laughable five-year, $7 million deal from 2012 that included three years of budget-friendly options.“This was a really unique negotiation, I think for both of the sides,” Thurman said this week. “There’s a lot of teams that may not have done this.”The Royals, the reigning World Series champions, have chosen to take an unusual approach to negotiations. They would rather reward players who outperform their contracts than take a hard-line approach, or buy out remaining arbitration years from their young stars than go to often-contentious hearings.AdvertisementIn essence, they have decided to purchase good will in hope that it will pay off down the road.“Some people will say, ‘Why didn’t you wait a year, wait a couple of years?’ ” said General Manager Dayton Moore, who signed Perez to the initial contract and the replacement deal. “We’ve said from Day 1, we want homegrown players. We want to grow our own, and once they produce, we want them long term.”AdvertisementOther teams have rewarded young players. Two years ago, Angels outfielder Mike Trout got $1 million, a record for a pre-arbitration deal, which ultimately led to a $144.5 million deal covering 2015-20.

But there are teams that prefer to take a more frugal approach.The Pirates gave Gerrit Cole, their young ace, a $538,000 contract this season; players with less than three years of service in the major leagues must accept any salary at or over the minimum of $507,500. While it was a $7,000 boost from his base salary, it was less than he earned last season because he received a $10,000 All-Star bonus.Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington acknowledged a mistake had been made in computing Cole’s salary and increased it to $541,000 for this year, matching last year’s total. But when Cole asked for more, the Pirates threatened to reduce his salary to the major league minimum, he told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Yankees and the Dodgers will almost always be able to outspend them for a front-line starter or an established position player. So the ability to develop and creatively retain homegrown stars is paramount to being a consistent winner in Kansas City.One way to do that: establishing a culture where players feel valued. The pocketbook is a good place to start.“Everyone knew that Salvy was outperforming the contract that he had,” said the All-Star outfielder Alex Gordon, who signed a four-year, $72 million deal to stay with Kansas City this off-season. “I think everyone knew that it was the right thing to do.”It seems as if everyone noticed, too.First baseman Eric Hosmer can become a free agent after next season and will almost certainly command a fortune on the open market. But he said that seeing the way Perez was treated would stick in his mind.“We all trust Dayton in here. We all trust everybody to do their part,” Hosmer said. “He’s brought in plenty of the pieces to help us be a championship team. He’s our guy. That’s our leader.”A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2016, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Small-Market Royals Bargain With Big Heart.
