The San Antonio Spurs, though, are assembling a magical season of their own, and they stifled the Warriors, 87-79, on Saturday night at AT&T Center to make a little history of their own.No teams with better combined records had ever faced each other this late in a regular season, and with their victory, the Spurs extended a remarkable streak, defeating the Warriors in 33 straight regular-season home games dating to 1997, when Tim Duncan was still in college.The Spurs (59-10) put the clamps on the Warriors (62-7), limited them to 37.8 percent shooting and swarmed Stephen Curry on the perimeter. Curry shot 4 of 18 from the field and finished with 14 points, one of his poorest outings of the season.LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with a game-high 26 points and made a clutch jumper for a 5-point lead with less than two minutes to play.The Warriors were playing their second game in two nights after defeating the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. The scheduling doyens at N.B.A. headquarters were not doing the Warriors any favors, and Golden State was also short-handed as Andre Iguodala (left ankle), Festus Ezeli (left knee) and Andrew Bogut (left big toe) missed the game.In Bogut’s absence, Coach Steve Kerr had little choice but to shift Draymond Green to center from power forward, but the team’s perimeter play was the more glaring issue — and it was evident early. After missing his first three 3-point attempts, Curry had his fourth blocked by the Spurs’ Danny Green.Paying special attention to Curry, the Spurs extended their defense beyond the 3-point line. The Warriors looked lost in the first half, and the game settled into the slow rhythm that favored the Spurs. Curry and Klay Thompson combined to shoot 5 of 19 from the field, yet the Spurs led by only 6 at halftime. Thompson finished with 15 points.Curry swapped his sneakers before the start of the third quarter and kept searching for a rhythm that never surfaced.Advertisement
