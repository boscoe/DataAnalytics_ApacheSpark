RIO DE JANEIRO — Last summer, a handful of Brazilian law enforcement officers traveled to Washington State on an unusual mission: to learn the etiquette and nuances of golf.At the United States Open at Chambers Bay, the Brazilians were shown where they should stand on the course so they could protect players but not be struck with a ball or a club.They were taught when they needed to remain in place so their movements did not distract golfers during their swings, and which ear pieces to use with their walkie-talkies so radio chatter did not disturb the players.“You can take the world’s best security minds, but if they don’t understand golf, they are worth very little value at the venue,” said Don Donovan, the chief security adviser for the United States Golf Association, which hosted the Brazilian law enforcement officials for a tutorial at the event.AdvertisementThe trip to the Open was just one of dozens made over the past several years by Brazilian Olympic officials, organizers and security experts to golf tournaments in the United States, where Brazilians learned the basics of a game that has little following in their country.There are only about 125 golf courses in Brazil, compared with roughly 14,500 in the United States. In 2009, a week after Rio de Janeiro was chosen as the host of the 2016 Games, golf was added to the Rio lineup, returning to the Olympics for the first time since 1904. But unlike the other finalists to host — Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago — Rio de Janeiro did not have a course that was suitable for a premier golf tournament.Advertisement“The great thing about golf is that pretty much every major city in the world has a golf course capable of hosting a golf tournament, but they picked out the one city that doesn’t,” said Ty Votaw, the vice president of the International Golf Federation.The Olympic men’s golf tournament began Thursday, with many of the world’s top players having dropped out of the competition, citing security concerns and fears that they would contract the Zika virus. Marcus Fraser of Australia, who made the Olympic team after four of his higher-ranked countrymen withdrew, shot an eight-under-par 63 to take a three-shot lead over Henrik Stenson of Sweden and Graham DeLaet of Canada.Officials acknowledged that simply pulling off the men’s and women’s golf tournaments might be their biggest accomplishment, having navigated significant obstacles like building a course and training employees to manage it and run a tournament.Courses are typically built in two years, but the one in Rio de Janeiro, on a 140-acre property near the Olympic Village, took six years. The architect and greens keeper moved to Brazil to work on the project, and agronomists and officials from the PGA Tour’s Design and Construction Services made 100 trips to Brazil. Heavy equipment, like lawn mowers and green rollers, was shipped in from abroad.“We needed every day we could get to be ready at this point of time,” said Mr. Votaw, who also serves as the PGA Tour’s chief marketing officer.

It was very important to hear it directly from them so we knew that we were headed in the right direction.”At Chambers Bay, American officials explained that fans at golf events, unlike those at soccer matches, are not allowed to bring in noisemakers or chant. The visiting Brazilian officers were shown the type of hand signals that security officers use on the course to communicate with one another so they do not disturb the golfers.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And the Brazilians were given tips on how to create a protective border around such a large event.“They are aware this is different than anything else they’ve gone through, and it’s a unique space for them to have to patrol,” said Antony Scanlon, the executive director of the International Golf Federation. “It’s a large expanse — five square kilometers of field of play — where normally they are used to a rectangular soccer field.”Olympic organizers also traveled to PGA Tour events to learn the intricacies of running a tournament, like how and when to quiet fans and the difficulties of daylong rounds.The Brazilians were taught how to manage the flow of fans. They were told not to overreact when they saw spectators running on the course because they were most likely trying to see where a ball landed, not fleeing some type of attack.Unlike soccer or volleyball, the sports Brazilians are more accustomed to, golf has fans scattered across the field of play, and they are allowed to cross onto the fairways as they make their way around the course. The organizers had to be prepared to explain to fans when they would be able to pass between roped-off areas.Roughly four dozen volunteers have come from the United States and Europe to work on the course and at the tournament.Officials are expecting that roughly 60 to 70 percent of the crowd will be Brazilians who have little familiarity with the game. To educate them, there were videos at the course’s entrance that give fans guidance on how they should behave. (Those instructions may not matter: Raucous Brazilian crowds have already changed the atmosphere at other normally quiet events like table tennis.)Advertisement“It’s telling them not to take photos in people’s backswing, keep quiet when players are forming a shot, those types of things — listen to the marshals,” Mr. Scanlon said.The first golfer on the tee on Thursday morning was Adilson da Silva, Brazil’s highest-ranked golfer, at No. 288. Now 44, he began golfing at 17, a relatively late age among pros. He said that Brazil was “still very young” when it came to golf and that the Olympic tournament would help bring more people to the sport.“Golf, it’s growth, it’s learning, and it’s growing with it,” da Silva said at a news conference Monday. “It’s just getting in there and do it. It’s a big thing — it’s a big learning curve.”Christoper Clarey Contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on August 12, 2016, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Rio Organizers Took Golf Lessons From the U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
