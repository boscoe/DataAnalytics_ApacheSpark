They went ahead to stay with 13 straight points in the third quarter.Stanford (32-6) took a big hit when the star senior guard Karlie Samuelson sprained her right ankle about four and a half minutes before halftime after the Cardinal had taken an 8-point lead with a 13-1 run.South Carolina’s Dawn Staley, who played for Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer on the United States women’s team that won the 1996 Olympic gold medal, won as a coach against VanDerveer for the first time in six tries.Staley also made three consecutive Final Four appearances as a player for Virginia from 1990 to 1992. Two of those appearances resulted in semifinal losses to VanDerveer and the Cardinal, who went on to their only national titles in 1990 and 1992.Samuelson was hurt making a move toward the basket.

She grabbed near her ankle with both hands after falling down.Two teammates came off the bench to carry Samuelson off the floor.Samuelson, who finished scoreless while playing 25 minutes and taking only two shots, returned to start the second half. But she was back on the bench after 73 seconds, standing behind the bench briefly while stretching her ankle and grimacing. She entered the game several more times but was clearly far from 100 percent.Samuelson’s younger sister, Katie Lou, played for Connecticut in the other semifinal game Friday night in the home of the N.B.A.’s Dallas Mavericks.
